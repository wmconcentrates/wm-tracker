WM TRACKER LOCAL PRINT SERVER SETUP
====================================

This lets staff print directly to the Zebra printer from their phones
while on the shop WiFi.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Windows PC connected to the shop network
- Node.js installed (https://nodejs.org)
- The .env.local file with your Supabase credentials

QUICK START:
1. Copy this entire wm-tracker folder to the shop PC
2. Make sure .env.local is in the folder (contains your API keys)
3. Double-click "start-local-server.bat"
4. Note the IP address shown (e.g., http://10.1.10.100:3000)
5. Staff bookmark that URL on their phones

SET STATIC IP (Recommended):
To keep the same URL, give the PC a static IP:
1. Open Settings > Network & Internet > Ethernet (or WiFi)
2. Click "Edit" under IP assignment
3. Set to Manual, enable IPv4
4. Set IP: 10.1.10.100 (or similar available IP)
5. Subnet: 255.255.255.0
6. Gateway: 10.1.10.1 (your router IP)
7. Save

AUTO-START ON BOOT:
1. Press Win+R, type: shell:startup
2. Create a shortcut to "start-local-server.bat" in that folder
3. The server will start automatically when Windows boots

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- "Node.js not installed" - Download from https://nodejs.org
- Can't connect from phone - Make sure phone is on shop WiFi
- Printer not working - Check printer IP in index.html (search for 10.1.10.95)
