A Regulated Marijuana Cultivation Facility’s cultivation process may achieve a Reduced Testing Allowance for contaminant testing if every HarvestProduction Batch that it produced during at least a six-week period (minimum 42 days) but no longer than a 12-week period (maximum 84 days) passed all contaminant tests required by Rule 4-215(E). This must include at least six Test Batches. The period begins from the date of the creation of the first Harvest Batch that passed Reduced Testing Allowance testing. A MedicalRegulated Marijuana Cultivation Facility, a Retail Marijuana Cultivation Facility, or an Accelerator Cultivator can achieve a Reduced Testing Allowance for all contaminants listed in Rule 4-215(E) at the same time or separately for each contaminant. A Regulated Marijuana Cultivation Facility must cultivate and process all Harvest Batches or Production Batches the same way, including the same growing media, lighting, pesticides, and drying, trimming, and packaging procedures to be eligible to obtain and maintain a Reduced Testing Allowance. 2. Regulated Marijuana Concentrate, Regulated Marijuana Product, Pre-Rolled Marijuana or Infused Pre-Rolled Marijuana. A Regulated Marijuana Business’s production process may achieve a Reduced Testing Allowance for contaminant testing if for a particular type of Regulated Marijuana Concentrate, Regulated Marijuana Product, or Pre-Rolled Marijuana or Infused Pre-Rolled Marijuana every Production Batch that it produced during at least a four-week period (minimum 28 days) but no longer than an eight-week period (maximum 56 days) passed all contaminant tests required by Rule 4-215(E). This must include Test Batches from at least four Production Batches. This period begins from the date of the creation of the first Production Batch that passed Reduced Testing Allowance testing. If a Regulated Marijuana Concentrate or Regulated Marijuana Product is manufactured using a different extraction process or infusion process or different hardware (such as different cartridge size, design, volume, or manufacturer) or using any different Additives or Botanically Derived Compounds, it will be considered a different type of Regulated Marijuana Concentrate or Regulated Marijuana Product and therefore must separately achieve a Reduced Testing Allowance. If Pre-Rolled Marijuana or Infused Pre-Rolled Marijuana is produced using different input materials, such as a different marijuana category (e.g. flower or trim), different wrapper materials, different processes, or different equipment, they must achieve separate Reduced Testing Allowances. C. Wet Whole Plant. A Regulated Marijuana Cultivation Facility’s cultivation process for wet whole plant shall be deemed acceptable for a Reduced Testing Allowance for microbial contaminant testing if every HarvestProduction Batch of wet whole plant that it produced during at least a CODE OF COLORADO REGULATIONS 1 CCR 212-3 Marijuana Enforcement Division 271 three-week (minimum 21 days) period but no longer than a 12-week (maximum 84 days) period passed all microbial contaminant tests required by this Rule 4-215(E). This must include at least six Test Batches. A MedicalRegulated Marijuana Cultivation Facility, a Retail Marijuana Cultivation Facility, or an Accelerator Cultivator can achieve a Reduced Testing Allowance for contaminants listed in this Rule 4-215(E)30 at the same time or separately for each contaminant. D. Reduced Testing Allowance - Potency and Homogeneity. 1. A Retail Marijuana Products Manufacturer or Accelerator Manufacturer may achieve a Reduced Testing Allowance for potency and homogeneity for each type of Retail Marijuana Product it manufactures. a. For Edible Retail Marijuana Products a potency test result that is within 15 percent of the target potency will count towards a Reduced Testing Allowance. i. For Edible Retail Marijuana Products that contain 2.5 milligrams of THC a Cannabinoid or less per serving, a potency test result that is within the greater of plus or minus 0.5 milligrams or 40 percent per serving will count towards a Reduced Testing Allowance. 2. A Medical Marijuana Products Manufacturer may achieve a Reduced Testing Allowance for potency and homogeneity for each type of non-Edible Medical Marijuana Product and each type of Edible Medical Marijuana Product that it manufactures. a. For Edible Medical Marijuana Products that contain 100 milligrams of THC or less per Container, a potency test result that is within 15 percent of the target potency will count towards a Reduced Testing Allowance. i. For Edible Medical Marijuana Products that contain 2.5 milligrams of THC a Cannabinoid or less per serving and 100 milligrams of THC or less per Container, a potency test result that is within the greater of plus or minus 0.5 milligrams or 40 percent per serving will count towards a Reduced Testing Allowance. b. For Edible Medical Marijuana Products that contain between 101 and 500 milligrams of THC per Container, a potency test result that is within 10 percent of the target potency will count towards a Reduced Testing Allowance. c. For Edible Medical Marijuana Products that contain 501 milligrams of THC or more per Container, a potency test result that is within 5 percent of the target potency will count towards a Reduced Testing Allowance. 3. A Regulated Marijuana Products Manufacturer’s production process for a particular type of Regulated Marijuana Product shall be deemed acceptable for a Reduced Testing Allowance for potency and homogeneity testing if every Production Batch that it produces for that particular type of Regulated Marijuana Product during at least a four-week period but no longer than an eight-week period passes all potency and homogeneity tests required by Rule 4-210. This must include at least four Test Batches. E. Expiration of a Reduced Testing Allowance. Once a Regulated Marijuana Business has successfully achieved Reduced Testing Allowance for any contaminants listed in Rule 4-215 or Potency as required by 4-210(E), Reduced Testing Allowance is effective for one year from the date of the first passing Harvest Batch or Production Batch. One year is equal to 365 days inclusive, or 366 days inclusive during a leap year. When the Reduced Testing Allowance CODE OF COLORADO REGULATIONS 1 CCR 212-3 Marijuana Enforcement Division 272 expires, the Regulated Marijuana Business shall achieve new Reduced Testing Allowance or Perform all testing Required by 4-210 and 4-215. F. Reduced Testing Allowance Certification Fee. A Licensee seeking to obtain Reduced Testing Allowance must first pay the fee in Rule 2-140(A). 1. A Licensee who chooses to pay the Reduced Testing Allowance fee must also submit an attestation form that at a minimum requires the Licensee attest they understand these testing Rules and requirements. 2.
