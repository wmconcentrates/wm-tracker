CODE OF COLORADO REGULATIONS 1 CCR 212-3 
Marijuana Enforcement Division 
 459 
9. For qualitative methods, a minimum of three spiking/naturally occurring levels of target 
analyte must be included assessing accuracy, precision and specificity per each matrix

which no analyte is present, one low level at which analyte is present at the regulatory 
limit and one high level at which the analyte is present at 10x the regulatory limit. 
10. For quantitative methods, laboratories must include a minimum of four or more spiked 
levels or more, covering the analytical range that assessesmust be included assessing 
accuracy, precision and specificity perof each matrix validated.: These must include one 
negative level in which no analyte is present, one low level at which analyte is present at 
the regulatory limit, one medium level for which the analyte is present at a concentration 
close to the middle calibrator and one high level at which the analyte is present at the

15. Laboratories must validate or verify instrumentation and methodology immediately and 
prior to use following a change in location. 
J. Testing Validation of Complex Matrices. A Retail Marijuana Testing Facility must include a variety 
of matrices as part of the validation/verification process. During method validation/verification, a 
Retail Marijuana Testing Facility must: 
1. Select matrices which best represent each category of products to be tested as listed in 
Rule 4-215. The laboratory shall independently determine the category of matrix a 
product falls within; properties to consider include fat content, Cannabinoid content, pH, 
salt content, sugar content, water activity, the presence of know chemical compounds, 
microbial flora and antimicrobial compounds. 
2. Perform a new matrix validation, prior to reporting results, on matrices which are either A) 
a new category of matrix or B) considerably different from the original matrix validated 
within the category. 
a. For example, the Retail Marijuana Testing Facility intends to receive the topical 
product “bath bombs” for testing, but previous validation studies for topical 
product included lotion and massage oil. A new validation should be performed 
for the product prior to testing since salt content and other properties differ vastly 
from the original matrices validated. 
3. Perform a matrix verification (a client matrix spike or similar consisting of the target 
analyte(s) at the time of analysis) on matrices submitted for testing which differ slightly 
from those initially validated but which fall within a category already validated. 
a. For example, the Retail Marijuana Testing Facility receives a new edible type 
matrix for testing (snickerdoodle cookies) but previous validation included 
gummies and hard candy. A spike of a portion of the submitted material must be 
analyzed prior to, or at the time of, sample analysis. 
K. All Test Batches and Hemp Product must be tested as received, must not be manipulated, and 
must be tested in a manner that ensures results are representative of the Test Batch as it is 
received. 
L. Repealed.

5. Chemical quality controls must not exceed a variance of plus or minus 40.0% recovery of 
the target value when analytes are greater than or equal to 10 ppb.

the target value when analytes are greater than or equal to 1.0 ppb. 
7. Microbiology quality controls must not exceed a variance of plus or minus 20.0% 
recovery of the target value.

Correction factors must be applied when such a factor could impact the final result; and 
9. Calibrate analytical timers annually.

must participate in a Proficiency Testing program for each approved category in which it seeks 
certification under Rule 6-415 – Retail Marijuana Testing Facilities: Certification Requirements.

the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and the Division, or the 
laboratory shall provide the Proficiency Testing results to the Colorado Department of 
Public Health and Environment and the Division within 3 business days after the 
laboratory receives notification of their results. 
C. Continued Certification. To maintain continued certification, a Retail Marijuana Testing Facility 
must participate in the designated Proficiency Testing program with continued satisfactory 
performance as determined by the Division as part of certification. The Division may designate a 
local agency, state agency, or independent third-party to provide Proficiency Testing. 
D. Analyzing Proficiency Testing Samples. A Retail Marijuana Testing Facility must analyze 
Proficiency Test Samples using the same procedures with the same number of replicate 
analyses, standards, testing analysts and equipment as used in its Standard Operating 
Procedures.

when a score of less than 100% is achieved on any test during Proficiency Testing. Remedial 
action documentation must include a review of Test Batches tested and results reported since the 
last successful Proficiency Testing event. A requirement to take remedial action does not 
necessarily indicate unsatisfactory participation in a Proficiency Testing event. 
H. Unsatisfactory Participation in a Proficiency Testing Event. Unless the Retail Marijuana Testing 
Facility positively identifies at least 80% of the target analytes tested, participation in the 
Proficiency Testing event will be considered unsatisfactory. A positive identification must include 
accurate quantitative and qualitative results as applicable. Any false positive result reported will 
be considered unsatisfactory participation in the Proficiency Testing event. 
I. Consequence of Unsatisfactory Participation in Proficiency Testing Event. Unsatisfactory 
participation in a Proficiency Testing event may result in limitation, suspension or revocation of 
Rule 6-415 certification. A Retail Marijuana Testing Facility’s certification will be suspended for 
the relevant testing category if two consecutive unsatisfactory Proficiency Testing events occur, 
or if two out of three consecutive unsatisfactory Proficiency Testing events occur. Certification 
may be reinstated after successful participation in the next Proficiency Testing event. Failure to 
achieve a satisfactory score in the next test event will result in the revocation of the certification 
and will require two successful consecutive Proficiency Testing events before the Testing Facility 
may be eligible to reapply for certification. 
J. Repealed.
