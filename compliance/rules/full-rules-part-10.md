ion Facilities that have multiple licenses 
at a single Licensed Premises and that do not have identical Controlling 
Beneficial Owners holding identical ownership percentages as of July 1, 2019, 
may continue operating all Medical Marijuana Cultivation Facility licenses that 
existed at that Licensed Premises prior to July 1, 2019. The maximum plant 
count for each such Medical Marijuana Cultivation Facility will be calculated 
pursuant to subparagraph (B)(3) below based on the number of average plants 
actually cultivated by that Medical Marijuana Cultivation Facility during the period 
January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018. 
i. Medical Marijuana Cultivation Facilities that are permitted to continue 
operating multiple licenses at a single Licensed Premises after July 1, 
2019, may collapse through one or more approved change of ownership 
applications, or one or more voluntary license surrenders, establishing 
identical Controlling Beneficial Owners holding identical ownership 
percentages for all Medical Marijuana Cultivation Facilities at the single 
Licensed Premises. 
ii. For any change of ownership application or voluntary license surrender 
seeking collapse after July 1, 2019, the Medical Marijuana Cultivation

Facility shall identify the license that will survive. The Medical Marijuana 
Cultivation Facility license identified as the surviving license will remain 
after collapse; all other Medical Marijuana Cultivation Facility licenses will 
be surrendered at the time of collapse. 
iii. The class for the surviving Medical Marijuana Cultivation Facility license 
will be determined according to subparagraph (B)(3) below based on the 
aggregate average number of Medical Marijuana plants actually 
cultivated by all Medical Marijuana Cultivation Facility Licensees that 
were located at the Licensed Premises during the 180 days prior to the 
collapse. 
2. Collapse after July 1, 2019. After July 1, 2019, Medical Marijuana Cultivation Facility 
licenses shall be permitted to collapse at a single Licensed Premises through an 
approved change of location application if all Medical Marijuana Cultivation Facility 
licenses for which collapse is sought meet the following requirements: 
a. All Medical Marijuana Cultivation Facility licenses sought to be collapsed have 
been consistently operating for at least 180 days prior to the proposed collapse; 
b. All Medical Marijuana Cultivation Facility licenses sought to be collapsed have 
identical Controlling Beneficial Owners holding identical ownership percentages; 
c. There is no pending administrative action regarding any of Medical Marijuana 
Cultivation Facility licenses sought to be collapsed; 
d. The class for the surviving Medical Marijuana Cultivation Facility license has not 
been decreased in the 180 days prior to the change of location application; 
e. All Medical Marijuana Cultivation Facility Licensees identify the desired surviving 
license and agree that all other Medical Marijuana Cultivation Facility licenses will 
be surrendered at the time of collapse; and 
f. Determining Class for Surviving License. 
i. Surviving License Class Will Not Decrease. The class for the surviving 
license will not be decreased as a result of any approved change of 
location application. 
ii. Surrendered License is Class 1, Class 2, or Class 3. For the surviving 
license to increase one class or one increment of 3,000 plants if already 
higher than class 3, during the 180 days prior to the change of location 
application, the surrendered license must have cultivated at least 50% of 
the maximum authorized plant count and Transferred at least 85% of the 
inventory it produced during that time. 
iii. Surrendered License is Higher than Class 3. For the surviving license to 
increase by the maximum authorized plant count of the surrendered 
license, during the 180 days prior to the change of location application 
the surrendered license must have cultivated at least 50% of the 
maximum authorized plant count and Transferred at least 85% of the 
inventory it produced during that time. If during the 180 days prior to the 
change of location application, the surrendering license did not cultivate 
at least 50% of the maximum authorized plant count and Transfer at 
least 85% of the inventory it produced, the surviving license will only

Marijuana Enforcement Division 
 306 
increase one class or one increment of 3,000 plants if already higher 
than class 3.

cultivation history will be placed into the class 1 production management class. 
b. Any Medical Marijuana Cultivation Facility that artificially increases plant count or 
otherwise misrepresents any data in connection with its plant count will be placed 
into the class the Division determines it would have been placed into without the 
artificial increase or misrepresentation. 
4. Immature Plants. For purposes of calculating the maximum number of authorized plants, 
Immature Plants are excluded but must be fully accounted for in the Inventory Tracking 
System. 
5. Ground for Denial. The Division may deny an application for additional plants pursuant to

i. If potentially contaminated equipment, ingredients, or solvents used in 
the Remediation process are used for processing other ‘non 
Remediated’ material, the subsequent Production Batch made using the 
equipment, ingredients, or solvent must then be tested for elemental 
impurities, and the Production Batch made using that equipment, 
ingredients, or solvents is not eligible for testing exemptions through a 
Reduced Testing Allowance or otherwise exempt from required testing.

impurities testing and contains mercury, Licensees must additionally: 
i. Work with a certified industrial hygienist to develop and implement some 
form of monitoring program that is capable of detecting mercury vapor 
concentrations in the areas where material contaminated with mercury 
will be processed and can be used to generate time weighted average 
exposures to mercury vapor. The monitoring system must be sufficient to 
ensure airborne concentrations of mercury do not exceed Occupational 
Safety and Health Administration Permissible Exposure Limits for 
Airborne Contaminants. 
ii. Have a certified industrial hygienist approve the Licensee’s air handling 
system for managing mercury vapors in a fashion that is compliant with 
the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and other applicable

etc.), any workers exposed to dusts or particulates generated from the material 
must wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), including at 
minimum: gloves, American National Standards (ANSI) Z87.1 safety glasses, 
and a respirator rated to protect them from airborne dusts or particulates that 
may contain elemental impurities. Respirators should utilize National Institute for 
Occupational Safety and Health rated particulate filters of sufficient grade to 
prevent exposure to airborne dusts that could contain elemental impurities. 
i. Workers utilizing a respirator must comply with applicable Occupational 
Safety and Health Administration regulations regarding respirator use 
before handling contaminated material. This includes receiving respirator 
clearance from a qualified professional and passing a respirator fit test 
before using a respirator. 
d. Implement additional forms of environmental airborne particulate control, such as 
industrial air filtration systems, handling material inside of enclosures, etc. must 
be implemented by the Licensee to minimize the risk of exposure or cross
