5. Any changes to the approved other or new methodology must be revalidated and 
documented prior to testing Test Batches. 
6. The demonstration of testing validity must ensure consistent, accurate and reproducible 
analytical performance in the matrices tested by the laboratory. 
7. Method performance specifications must ensure analytical tests are sufficiently sensitive 
for the purposes of the detectability requirements of Rule 5-440(B). 
8. To the extent practicable, laboratory test methods must meet AOAC International 
standard method performance requirements. 
9. For qualitative methods, a minimum of three spiking/naturally occurring levels of target 
analyte must be included assessing accuracy, precision and specificity per each matrix 
validated (microbiological methods shall be considered accurate/precise if fractional 
results are obtained when limits are <1 CFU preanalytical portion): one negative level in 
which no analyte is present, one low level at which analyte is present at the regulatory 
limit and one high level at which the analyte is present at 10x the regulatory limit. 
10. For quantitative methods, laboratories must include a minimum of four or more spiked 
levels or more, covering the analytical range that assessesmust be included assessing 
accuracy, precision and specificity perof each matrix validated.: These must include one 
negative level in which no analyte is present, one low level at which analyte is present at 
the regulatory limit, one medium level for which the analyte is present at a concentration 
close to the middle calibrator and one high level at which the analyte is present at the 
upper level of the calibration. 
11. For qualitative methods, at least two levels must be included for the negative and high 
level spikes - at least ten replicates must be included at the fractional level, per analyte, 
per matrix. 
12. For quantitative methods, at least two replicates must be performed at each spiked level

J. Testing and Validation of Complex Matrices. A Medical Marijuana Testing Facility must include a 
variety of matrices as part of the validation/verification process. During method 
validation/verification, a Medical Marijuana Testing Facility must: 
1. Select matrices which best represent each category of products to be tested as listed in 
Rule 4-215. The laboratory shall independently determine the category of matrix a 
product falls within; properties to consider include fat content, Cannabinoid content, pH, 
salt content, sugar content, water activity, the presence of known chemical compounds, 
microbial flora and antimicrobial compounds. 
2. Perform a new matrix validation, prior to reporting results, on matrices which are either a 
new category of matrix or are considerably different from the original matrix validated 
within the category. 
a. For example, the Medical Marijuana Testing Facility intends to receive the topical 
product “bath bombs” for testing, but previous validation studies for topical 
product included lotion and massage oil. A new validation should be performed 
for the product prior to testing since salt content and other properties differ vastly 
from the original matrices validated. 
3. Perform a matrix verification (a client matrix spike or similar consisting of the target 
analyte(s) at the time of analysis) on matrices submitted for testing which differ slightly 
from those initially validated but which fall within a category already validated. 
a. For example, the Medical Marijuana Testing Facility laboratory receives a new 
edible type matrix for testing (snickerdoodle cookies) but previous validation 
included gummies and hard candy. A spike of a portion of the submitted material 
must be analyzed prior to, or at the time of, sample analysis. 
K. All Test Batches and Hemp Product must be tested as received, must not be manipulated, and 
must be tested in a manner that ensures results are representative of the Test Batch as it is 
received. 
L. Repealed.
