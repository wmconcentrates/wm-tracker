Constitution at Article XVIII, Subsections 16(3)(a), 16(5)(a)(V) and 16(5)(a)(VIII). The purpose of this rule 
is to clarify those acts that are limited in some fashion, or prohibited, by an Accelerator Store. Such 
limitations include, but are not limited to, quantity limitations on sales and equivalencies for Retail 
Marijuana Concentrate and Retail Marijuana Product to Retail Marijuana flower. The establishment of 
equivalencies also provides information to stakeholders including Licensees, the general public, and law 
enforcement to aid in the enforcement of and compliance with the lawful personal possession limit of one 
ounce or less of marijuana. Setting these equivalencies provides Accelerator Stores and their employees 
with necessary information to avoid being complicit in a patron acquiring more marijuana than is lawful to 
possess under the Colorado Constitution pursuant to Article XVIII, Subsection 16(3)(a).

administrative hold, the investigator will send the Licensee written notification of 
the reason the administrative hold is being lifted. 
b. At any time after the initiation of the administrative hold, the State Licensing 
Authority may lift, revise, or extend the administrative hold. 
c. An administrative hold expires after 120 days unless an administrative action has 
been initiated concerning the Regulated Marijuana subject to the administrative 
hold, or the State Licensing Authority extends the administrative hold. 
d. The State Licensing Authority’s order to extend the administrative hold will 
identify the reasons for extending the administrative hold. The State Licensing 
Authority will only consider the following factors when deciding whether to extend 
an administrative hold: 
i. The need to preserve evidence for a pending administrative action; 
ii. The existence of a new or continued threat of diversion; 
iii. The existence of a new or continued threat of public safety; 
iv. The Licensee’s failure to cooperate with Division investigators; 
v. The Licensee’s failure to maintain security and inventory controls, 
including record keeping and inventory tracking requirements, video 
surveillance, Security Alarm System, or lock requirements; 
vi. The Licensee’s failure to maintain all required state or local licenses; or 
vii. The Licensee’s current tax noncompliance. 
B.5. Embargo. 
1. Notice of Embargo. 
a. The Division may embargo Regulated Marijuana when there are objective and 
reasonable grounds to believe the Regulated Marijuana poses a risk to health, 
safety, or welfare of the public that imperatively requires emergency action. 
b. A Division investigator will issue a Notice of Embargo to only the Licensee from 
which the Regulated Marijuana originated including a description of the 
Regulated Marijuana and identifying any permitted activities regarding the 
Regulated Marijuana subject to the embargo. Following the issuance of a Notice 
of Embargo, the Division will identify the Regulated Marijuana subject to embargo 
in the Inventory Tracking System. The Licensee shall issue a recall pursuant to 
Rule 3-336 for Regulated Marijuana subject to an embargo. The recall can only 
be terminated with approval of the Division. With approval from the Division, a 
Licensee subject to the Notice of Embargo may instruct other Licensees to 
destroy the affected Regulated Marijuana as part of the recall. The Division may 
also notify Licensees that received the embargoed Regulated Marijuana of the 
embargo and requirement that the Regulated Marijuana be physically 
segregated. The Licensee shall continue to comply with all tracking 
requirements. See Rule 3-805 – Regulated Marijuana Businesses: Inventory 
Tracking System. 

CODE OF COLORADO REGULATIONS 1 CCR 212-3 
Marijuana Enforcement Division 
 539 
c. The Senior Director, or their designee, shall promptly approve and issue a 
concise statement regarding the reasons for issuing the embargo. 
2. The Effect of Embargo. 
a. The Licensee shall completely and physically segregate the Regulated Marijuana 
subject to the embargo in a Limited Access Area of the Licensed Premises. 
b. While the embargo is in effect, the Licensee is prohibited from Transferring, or 
transporting the Regulated Marijuana subject to the embargo, except as 
otherwise authorized by this Rule 8-110. The Licensee can choose to destroy the 
Regulated Marijuana that is the subject of the embargo at its expense, with 
advance approval from and in coordination with the Division and in accordance 
with Rule 3-230 – Waste Disposal. 
c. While the embargo is in effect, the Licensee must safeguard the Regulated 
Marijuana subject to the embargo, must maintain the Licensed Premises in 
reasonable condition according to health, safety, and sanitary standards, and 
must fully comply with all security requirements including but not limited to video 
surveillance, lock and alarm requirements as set forth in the Marijuana Rules. 
3. Release, Destruction, and Opportunity for Hearing. 
a. At any time after service of a Notice of Embargo, the Division or the State 
Licensing Authority may lift, revise, or extend the embargo by agreement 
between the Division or the State Licensing Authority and the Licensee subject to 
the embargo. 
b. If a Notice of Destruction has not been issued after 120 days of the Notice of 
Embargo, the Licensee that received the Notice of Embargo from the Division 
investigator may submit a written request for a hearing before a Department of 
Revenue Hearing Officer. The issue at the hearing will be whether there are 
reasonable grounds to support that the Regulated Marijuana poses a risk to 
public health or safety and should be subject to destruction, should be subject to 
continued embargo, or does not pose a risk to public health and safety and 
should be released from the embargo. 
c. Within 60 days of receiving a Notice of Destruction, the Licensee receiving the 
Notice of Destruction may request a hearing pursuant to Rule 8-220(B). Failure 
to request a hearing within the 60-day time period automatically results in the 
Notice of Destruction becoming an order of destruction. 
d. If the Licensee receiving the Notice of Destruction requests a hearing, the 
hearing will be conducted by a Department of Revenue Hearing Officer pursuant 
to section 24-4-105, C.R.S. The sole issue at the hearing will be whether the 
Regulated Marijuana subject to the embargo poses a threat to the health, safety, 
or welfare of the public and therefore should be destroyed. Following the hearing, 
the Hearing Officer will issue an Initial Decision that is subject to exceptions and 
judicial review. 
e. If a destruction is ordered pursuant to this Rule 8-110(B.5)(3), the Licensee that 
received the Notice of Destruction is responsible for completing the destruction in 
coordination with the Division and in accordance with the Marijuana Rules. The 
Licensee receiving the Notice of Destruction is also responsible for all expenses 
related to the embargo and destruction of Regulated Marijuana. 

CODE OF COLORADO REGULATIONS 1 CCR 212-3 
Marijuana Enforcement Division 
 540 
4. The Division may seek the assistance of the Department of Public Health and 
Environment in connection with an embargo or a hearing seeking destruction of 
Regulated Marijuana. 
C. Voluntary Surrender of Regulated Marijuana. 
1. A Licensee, prior to a Final Agency Order and upon mutual agreement with the Division, 
may elect to voluntarily surrender any Regulated Marijuana to the Division. 
a. Such voluntary surrender may require destruction of any Regulated Marijuana in 
the presence of a Division investigator and at the Licensee’s expense. 
b. The individual signing the Division’s voluntary surrender form on behalf of the 
Licensee must certify that the individual has authority to represent and bind the 
Licensee. 
2. The voluntary surrender form may be utilized in connection with a stipulated agency order 
through which the Licensee waives the right to hearing and any associated rights. 
3. The voluntary surrender form may be utilized even if the Licensee does not waive the 
right to hearing and any associated rights, with the understanding that the outcome of the 
hearing does not impact the validity of the voluntary surrender. 
4. A Licensee, after a Final Agency Order and upon mutual agreement with the Division, 
may elect to voluntarily surrender any Regulated Marijuana to the Division. 
a. The Licensee must complete and return the Division's voluntary surrender form

b. Such voluntary surrender may require destruction of any Regulated Marijuana in 
the presence of a Division investigator and at the Licensee’s expense. 
c. The individual signing the Division’s voluntary surrender form on behalf of the 
Licensee must certify that the individual has authority to represent and bind the 
Licensee.

44-10-203(1)(f), 44-10-203(1)(g), 44-10-203(1)(k), and 44-10-902, C.R.S. The purpose of this rule is to 
provide guidance following either an agency decision or under any circumstances where the Licensee is 
ordered to surrender and/or destroy unauthorized Regulated Marijuana. This rule also provides guidance 
as to the need to preserve evidence during agency investigations or subject to agency order. This Rule 8-
115 was previously Rules M and R 1203, 1 CCR 212-1 and 1 CCR 212-2. 
8-115 – Disposition of Unauthorized Regulated Marijuana 
A. After a Final Agency Order Mandates the Destruction of Regulated Marijuana. If the State 
Licensing Authority issues a Final Agency Order pursuant to section 44-10-902, C.R.S., that 
orders the destruction of some or all of the Licensee’s unauthorized Regulated, the Licensee 
may: 
1. Voluntarily Surrender. The Licensee may voluntarily surrender to the Division all of its 
unauthorized Regulated Marijuana that are described in the Final Agency Order in

Division will enter upon the Licensed Premises and seize and destroy the unauthorized 
Regulated Marijuana that are the subject of the Final Agency Order. 
B. General Requirements Applicable To All Licensees Following Final Agency Order To Destroy 
Unauthorized Regulated Marijuana. The following requirements apply regardless of whether the 
Licensee voluntarily surrenders its unauthorized Regulated Marijuana, seeks a stay of agency 
action, or takes no action: 
1. The 15 day period set forth in section 44-10-902(5), C.R.S., and this Rule shall include

Licensing Authority or Court order. 
3. During the period of time between the issuance of the Final Agency Order and the 
destruction of unauthorized Regulated Marijuana, the Licensee must safeguard any

all security requirements including but not limited to video surveillance, lock and alarm 
requirements set forth in the Marijuana Code and the rules of the State Licensing 
Authority. 
4. Unless the State Licensing Authority otherwise orders, the Licensee may cultivate, water,

Regulated Marijuana until approved by the district attorney. 
Basis and Purpose – 8-120 
The statutory authority for this rule includes but is not limited to sections 44-10-202(1)(c), 44-10-203(1)(f), 
44-10-203(1)(g), 44-10-203(1)(k), and 44-10-203(2)(w), C.R.S. This rule explains that Division 
investigators may exercise discretion in issuing written warning when, during the course of a compliance 
check or investigation, the Division investigator identifies a violation(s) of the Marijuana Code or the rules 
promulgated thereunder. This rule also explains that the Director of the Division may exercise discretion 
to accept an assurance of voluntary compliance. It also explains the evidentiary value of a written warning 
or an assurance of voluntary compliance. This Rule 8-120 was previously Rules M and R 1204, 1 CCR 
212-1 and 1 CCR 212-2. 
8-120 – Written Warnings and Assurances of Voluntary Compliance 
A. Written Warnings. If a Division investigator identifies a violation(s) of the Marijuana Code or the 
rules promulgated thereunder that is not identified as ineligible for a written warning pursuant to 

CODE OF COLORADO REGULATIONS 1 CCR 212-3 
Marijuana Enforcement Division 
 542 
subpartparagraph (D) of this Rule, the Division investigator may issue a written warning in lieu of 
recommending immediate disciplinary administrative action. 
1. The written warning shall identify the alleged violation(s). 
2. The written warning shall not constitute an admission of a violation(s) for any purpose or 
finding of a violation(s) by the State Licensing Authority, and shall not be evidence that 
Licensee violated the Marijuana Code, or the rules promulgated thereunder. 
3. A written warning shall constitute evidence in any subsequent administrative proceeding, 
if relevant, that the Licensee was previously warned of the violation(s). 
4. The Division may in its discretion initiate a subsequent administrative action and prove 
the violation(s) that was the subject of the written warning 
B. Assurances of Voluntary Compliance. The Director of the Division may accept an assurance of 
voluntary compliance regarding any act or practice alleged to violate the Marijuana Code, or the 
rules promulgated thereunder that is not identified as ineligible for an assurance of voluntary 
compliance pursuant to subpartparagraph (D) of this Rule.

of the cost commensurate with the acts or practices and an amount necessary to restore 
money or property which may have been acquired by the alleged violator because of the 
act or practice. It may include stipulations for other terms such as the completion of 
training, submission of Standard Operating Procedures, or other agreed-upon terms. 
2. An assurance of voluntary compliance may not be considered an admission of a 
violation(s) for any purpose or a finding of a violation(s) by the State Licensing Authority; 
however, the assurance of voluntary compliance shall constitute evidence in any 
subsequent administrative proceeding that Licensee entered into an agreement to 
comply with the Marijuana Code, and/or the rules promulgated thereunder. 
3. The State Licensing Authority may approve or review an assurance of voluntary 
compliance. 
C. Not a Disciplinary Action. Neither a written warning nor an assurance of voluntary compliance 
constitutes a disciplinary action. 
D. Not Eligible for Written Warning or Assurance of Voluntary Compliance. If a Division investigator 
identifies a violation(s) of the Marijuana Code or rules promulgated thereunder, the following 
conduct is not eligible for a Written Warning or Assurance of Voluntary Compliance. 
1. Any disqualifying event prohibiting an Applicant or Licensee from holding a license 
pursuant to section 44-10-307, C.R.S.; 
2. Knowingly adulterating or altering a Sample Increment or Test Batch; 
3. Violations of Medical or Retail Marijuana Sales limits established by Rules 5-125 and 6-

possessing marijuana obtained from outside the regulated distribution system or from an 
authorized source; and 
7. Violation(s) for which the State Licensing Authority issued an Order of Summary 
Suspension or an Order of Show Cause to the Licensee. 
Basis and Purpose – 8-125 
The statutory authority for this rule includes but is not limited to sections 44-10-202(1)(b), 44-10-202(1)(c), 
44-10-202(5), 44-10-203(1)(e), 44-10-203(1)(g), 44-10-203(1)(k), 44-10-203(2)(l), C.R.S. The purpose of 
this rule is to establish the circumstances under which the State Licensing Authority may seek from a 
district court an investigative subpoena and what reasonable efforts the Division may take prior to seeking 
an investigative subpoena. The Division has encountered circumstances that would have justified such an 
investigative subpoena. Establishing the criteria under which the Division may seek an investigative 
subpoena will provide district courts guidelines under which to evaluate a petition for an investigative 
subpoena. 
8-125 – Investigative Subpoenas 
A. Criteria. The State Licensing Authority may petition a district court for an investigative subpoena 
applicable to a Person who is not licensed pursuant to the Marijuana Code to obtain documents 
or information necessary to enforce the Marijuana Code and these Rules after the Division has 
taken reasonable efforts to obtain requested documents or information. 
B. Reasonable Efforts. For purposes of this Rule 8-125, “reasonable efforts” may include but shall 
not be limited to obtaining the documents or information through a request to the unlicensed 
Person and such unlicensed Person has either declined to provide the documents or information, 
or failed to respond to the Division within the applicable time frame. 
C. Affidavit. When seeking an investigative subpoena, the Division will supply the district court with a 
sworn affidavit explaining the bases for seeking the subpoena. 
Basis and Purpose – 8-130 
The statutory authority for this rule includes but is not limited to sections 44-10-202(1)(c), 44-10-203(2)(e), 
44-10-203(2)(l), 44-10-203(1)(e), 44-10-203(1)(g), and 44-10-203(2)(w), C.R.S. The purpose of this rule is 
to establish the circumstances under which the Division may seek from a district court an administrative 
warrant to search and/or seize marijuana and marijuana products, or other evidence indicating a violation 
of the Marijuana Code or rules. The Division has encountered circumstances that would have justified 
such a warrant. Establishing the criteria under which the Division may seek an administrative warrant will 
give fair notice to the regulated community regarding the types of violations that would lead to a request 
for an administrative warrant. This Rule 8-130 was previously Rules M and R 1309, 1 CCR 212-1 and 1 
CCR 212-2. 
8-130 – Administrative Warrants 
A. Criteria. The Division may seek from a district court an administrative search warrant authorizing 
search and seizure in circumstances in which the Division makes a proper showing that: 
1. A Licensee has refused entry of Division investigators during business hours or times of 
apparent activity; 
2. A Licensee subject to an administrative hold or summary suspension has failed to comply 
with applicable rules; or 

CODE OF COLORADO REGULATIONS 1 CCR 212-3 
Marijuana Enforcement Division 
 544 
3. A Licensee otherwise has acted in a manner demonstrating disregard for the Marijuana 
Code and the State Licensing Authority’s rules or that threatens the public health, safety, 
and welfare. 
4. A sole Controlling Beneficial Owner is deceased and a Temporary Appointee Registration 
is not timely filed. 
B. Affidavit. When seeking an administrative search warrant, the Division will supply the district court 
with a sworn affidavit explaining the bases for seeking the warrant. 
C. Seized Property. If the Division seizes marijuana, neither the Division nor the State Licensing 
Authority shall cultivate or care for any seized marijuana or marijuana products. The Division may 
seek from the district court an order to destroy any such marijuana or marijuana products. 
8-200 Series – Discipline and Administrative Hearings 
Basis and Purpose – 8-205 
The statutory authority for this rule includes but is not limited to sections 44-10-202(1)(c), 44-10-202(1)(d), 
44-10-203(1)(k), 44-10-203(2)(a), 44-10-203(2)(l), 44-10-701, 44-10-901, and 24-4-105 C.R.S. Authority 
also exists in the Colorado Constitution at Article XVIII, Subsection 16(5)(a)(I). The purpose of this rule is 
to clarify how the disciplinary process for non-summary license suspensions and license revocations is 
initiated. This Rule 8-205 was previously Rules M and R 1301, 1 CCR 212-1 and 1 CCR 212-2. 
8-205 – Non-Summary Suspensions 
A. How a Disciplinary Action is Initiated. 
1. If the State Licensing Authority, on its own initiative or based on a complaint, has 
reasonable cause to believe that a Licensee has violated the Marijuana Code, any rule 
promulgated pursuant to it, or any of its orders, the State Licensing Authority shall issue 
and serve upon the Licensee an Order to Show Cause (administrative citation) as to why 
its license should not be suspended, revoked, restricted, fined, or subject to other 
disciplinary sanction. 
2. The Order to Show Cause shall identify the statute, rule, regulation, or order allegedly 
violated, and the facts alleged to constitute the violation. The order shall also provide an 
advisement that the license could be suspended, revoked, restricted, fined, or subject to 
other disciplinary sanction should the charges contained in the notice be sustained upon 
final hearing. 
B. Disciplinary Hearings. Disciplinary hearings will be conducted in accordance with Rule 8-220 – 
Administrative Hearings. 
C. Renewal. The issuance of an Order to Show Cause does not relieve the Licensee of the 
obligation to timely comply with all license renewal requirements. 
Basis and Purpose – 8-210 
The statutory authority for this rule includes but is not limited to sections 44-10-202(1)(c), 44-10-202(1)(d), 
44-10-203(1)(k), 44-10-203(2)(a), 44-10-203(2)(l), 24-4-104(4)(a), 44-10-701, 44-10-901, and 24-4-105, 
C.R.S. Authority also exists in the Colorado Constitution at Article XVIII, Subsection 16(5)(a)(I). The 
purpose of this rule is to set forth the process for summary suspensions when the State Licensing 
Authority has cause to immediately suspend a license prior to and pending a hearing and final agency 
order. Summary suspensions will be imposed when the State Licensing Authority has reason to believe 

CODE OF COLORADO REGULATIONS 1 CCR 212-3 
Marijuana Enforcement Division 
 545 
and finds that a Licensee has been guilty of a deliberate and willful violation of any applicable law or 
regulation, or that the public health, safety, and welfare imperatively require emergency action. The rule 
ensures proper due process for Licensees when their licenses are temporarily or summarily suspended 
by requiring prompt initiation of disciplinary proceedings after such suspensions. The purpose of the 
modifications to this rule is to clarify that the hearing following the Order of Summary Suspension 
concerns the allegations set forth in the Order to Show Cause. This Rule 8-210 was previously Rules M 
and R 1302, 1 CCR 212-1 and 1 CCR 212-2. 
8-210 – Summary Suspensions 
A. How a Summary Suspension Action is Initiated. 
1. When the State Licensing Authority has reasonable grounds to believe and finds that a 
Licensee has been guilty of a deliberate and willful violation of any applicable law or 
regulation or that the public health, safety, or welfare imperatively requires emergency 
action it shall serve upon the Licensee a Summary Suspension Order that temporarily or 
summarily suspends the license. 
2. The Summary Suspension Order shall identify the nature of the State Licensing 
Authority’s basis for the summary suspension. The Summary Suspension Order shall 
also provide an advisement that the License may be subject to further discipline or 
revocation following a hearing on an Order to Show Cause. 
3. Proceedings for suspension or revocation shall be promptly instituted and determined 
after the Summary Suspension Order is issued in accordance with the following 
procedure: 
a. After the Summary Suspension Order is issued, the State Licensing Authority 
shall promptly issue and serve upon the Licensee an Order to Show Cause 
(administrative citation) as to why the Licensee's license should not be 
suspended, revoked, restricted, fined, or subject to other disciplinary sanction. 
b. The Order to Show Cause shall identify the statute, rule, regulation, or order 
allegedly violated, and the facts alleged to constitute the violation. The Order to 
Show Cause shall also provide an advisement that the license could be 
suspended, revoked, restricted, fined or subject to disciplinary sanction should 
the charges contained in the Order to Show Cause be sustained upon final 
hearing. 
c. The Order to Show Cause shall be filed with the Department’s Hearings Division. 
The hearing on the allegations set forth in the Order to Show Cause shall be 
expedited to the extent practicable and will be conducted in accordance with 
Rule 8-220 – Administrative Hearings. 
B. Duration of Summary Suspension. Unless lifted by the State Licensing Authority, the Summary 
Suspension Order shall remain in effect until issuance of a Final Agency Order. 
Basis and Purpose – 8-215 
The statutory authority for this rule includes but is not limited to sections 44-10-202(1)(c), 44-10-202(1)(d), 
44-10-203(1)(k), 44-10-203(2)(a), 44-10-203(2)(l), 44-10-701, 44-10-901, 24-4-104(4)(a), and 24-4-105, 
C.R.S. Authority also exists in the Colorado Constitution at Article XVIII, Subsection 16(5)(a)(I). The State 
Licensing Authority recognizes that if Licensees are not able to care for their products during a period of 
active suspension, then their plants could die, their edible products could deteriorate, and their on-hand 
inventory may not be properly maintained. Accordingly, this rule was written to clarify that Licensees 

CODE OF COLORADO REGULATIONS 1 CCR 212-3 
Marijuana Enforcement Division 
 546 
whose licenses are summarily suspended may care for on-hand inventory, manufactured products, and 
plants during the suspension (unless the State Licensing Authority does not allow such activity), provided 
the Licensed Premises and all Regulated Marijuana is adequately secured. In addition, the rule clarifies 
what activity is always prohibited during such suspension. This Rule 8-215 was previously Rules M and R 
1303, 1 CCR 212-1 and 1 CCR 212-2. 
8-215 – Suspension Process: Regular and Summary Suspensions 
A. Signs Required During Suspension. Every Licensee whose license has been suspended, whether 
summarily or after an administrative hearing, shall post two notices in conspicuous places, one on 
the exterior and one on the interior of its premises, for the duration of the suspension. The notices 
shall be at least 17 inches in length and 11 inches in width containing lettering not less than 1/2'’ 
in height. 
1. For suspension following issuance of a Final Agency Order, the sign shall be in the 
following form: 
NOTICE OF SUSPENSION 
REGULATED MARIJUANA LICENSES ISSUED 
FOR THESE PREMISES HAVE BEEN 
SUSPENDED BY ORDER OF THE STATE LICENSING AUTHORITY 
FOR VIOLATION OF THE COLORADO MARIJUANA CODE 
2. For a summary suspension pending issuance of a Final Agency Order, the sign shall be 
in the following form: 
NOTICE OF SUSPENSION 
REGULATED MARIJUANA LICENSES ISSUED 
FOR THESE PREMISES HAVE BEEN 
SUSPENDED BY ORDER OF THE STATE LICENSING AUTHORITY 
FOR ALLEGED VIOLATION OF THE COLORADO MARIJUANA CODE 
Any advertisement or posted signs that indicate that the premises have been closed or business 
suspended for any reason other than by the manner described in this Rule shall be deemed a 
violation of these rules. 
B. Prohibited Activity During Active Suspension. 
1. Unless otherwise ordered by the State Licensing Authority, during any period of active 
license suspension the Licensee shall not permit the serving, giving away, distribution, 
manufacture, sampling, acquisition, purchase, testing, Transfer, or transport of Regulated 
Marijuana on or from the Licensed Premises, nor allow patients or consumers to enter 
the Licensed Premises. 
2. Unless otherwise ordered by the State Licensing Authority, during any period of 
suspension the Licensee may continue to possess, maintain, cultivate, or harvest 
Regulated Marijuana on the Licensed Premises. The Licensee must fully account for all 

CODE OF COLORADO REGULATIONS 1 CCR 212-3 
Marijuana Enforcement Division 
 547 
such Regulated Marijuana in the Inventory Tracking System. The Licensee must 
safeguard any Regulated Marijuana in its possession or control. The Licensee must 
possess and maintain the Licensed Premises in reasonable condition according to 
health, safety, and sanitary standards, and must fully comply with all security 
requirements including but not limited to video surveillance, lock and alarm requirements 
set forth in the Marijuana Code and the rules of the State Licensing Authority. 
3. Unless otherwise ordered by the State Licensing Authority, the Licensee shall not 
exercise any privileges of an Employee License on behalf of any Regulated Marijuana 
Business License during any period of license suspension or if the License has been 
revoked by final agency order of the State Licensing Authority. 
C. Removal and Destruction of Regulated Marijuana. Regulated Marijuana shall not be removed 
from the Licensed Premises or destroyed unless: 
1. The provisions described in section 44-10-902, C.R.S., related to the proper destruction 
of unauthorized marijuana are met, and the State Licensing Authority orders forfeiture 
and destruction. See also Rule 8-115 – Disposition of Unauthorized Regulated Marijuana; 
2. The Licensee has voluntarily surrendered the Regulated Marijuana in accordance with 
Rule 8-110(C) – Voluntary Surrender; or 
3. The State Licensing Authority has seized the Regulated Marijuana pursuant to an 
Administrative Warrant. See Rule 8-130 – Administrative Warrant. 
D. Renewal. The issuance of an Order to Show Cause or an Order of Summary Suspension does 
not relieve the Licensee of the obligation to timely comply with all license renewal requirements. 
The Division’s approval of any renewal application filed by a Licensee while subject to an Order to 
Show Cause or an Order of Summary Suspension shall not constitute a Final Agency Order or an 
agreement to a settlement of the administrative action. The Licensee shall continue to comply 
with the requirements of this Rule pending a Final Agency Order resolving the Order of Summary 
Suspension and any related Order to Show Cause. 
Basis and Purpose – 8-220 
The statutory authority for this rule includes but is not limited to sections 44-10-202(1)(c), 44-10-202(1)(d), 
44-10-203(1)(k), 44-10-203(2)(a), 44-10-203(2)(g), 44-10-203(2)(l), 44-10-204(1)(a), 44-10-701, 44-10-
901, 24-4-104, and 24-4-105, C.R.S. Authority also exists in the Colorado Constitution at Article XVIII, 
Subsection 16(5)(a)(I). The purpose of this rule is to establish what entity conducts the administrative 
hearings, the procedures governing administrative hearings, and other general hearings issues. The 
purpose of the modifications to this rule is to clarify that the hearing following the Order of Summary

A. General Procedures. 
1. Hearing Location. Hearings will generally be conducted by the Department’s Hearings 
Division. Hearings will be held virtually unless otherwise ordered by the hearing officer for 
good cause. “Good cause” for an in-person hearing means that there are unusual 
circumstances where justice, judicial economy, and convenience of the parties would be 
served by holding a hearing in person. The Division, Respondent or Denied Applicant 
may request a hearing officer order an in-person hearing upon a showing of good cause.

incapacitation of a party or an attorney for a party; a court order staying 
proceedings or otherwise necessitating a continuance; entry or substitution of an 
attorney for a party a reasonable time prior to the hearing, if the entry or 
substitution reasonably requires a postponement of the hearing; a change in the 
parties or pleadings sufficiently significant to require a postponement; a showing 
that more time is clearly necessary to complete authorized discovery or other 
mandatory preparation for the hearing; or agreement of the parties to a 
settlement of the case which has been or will likely be approved by the final

CODE OF COLORADO REGULATIONS 1 CCR 212-3 
Marijuana Enforcement Division 
 550 
testimony can be taken by telephone or by deposition; or failure of an attorney or 
a party timely to prepare for the hearing. 
E. Prehearing Matters Generally. 
1. Prehearing Conferences Once a Hearing is Set. Prehearing conferences may be held at 
the discretion of the hearing officer upon request of any party, or upon the hearing 
officer’s own motion. If a prehearing conference is held and a prehearing order is issued 
by the hearing officer, the prehearing order will control the course of the proceedings. 
2. Depositions. Depositions are generally not allowed; however, a hearing officer has 
discretion to allow a deposition if a party files a written motion and can show why such 
deposition is necessary to prove its case. When a hearing officer grants a motion for a 
deposition, C.R.C.P. 30 controls. Hearings will not be continued because a deposition is 
allowed unless (a) both parties stipulate to a continuance and the hearing officer grants 
the continuance, or (b) the hearing officer grants a continuance over the objection of any 
party in accordance with subsections (D)(2)(b) and (c) of this Rule. 
3. Prehearing Statements Once a Hearing is Set. Prehearing Statements are required and 
unless otherwise ordered by the hearing officer, each party shall file with the hearing 
officer and serve on each party a prehearing statement no later than seven calendar days 
prior to the hearing. Parties shall also exchange exhibits at that time. Parties shall not file 
exhibits with the hearing officer. Parties shall exchange exhibits by the date on which 
prehearing statements are to be filed. Prehearing statements shall include the following 
information: 
a. Witnesses. The name, mailing address, and telephone number of any witness 
whom the party may call at hearing, together with a detailed statement of the 
expected testimony. 
b. Experts. The name, mailing address, and brief summary of the qualifications of 
any expert witness a party may call at hearing, together with a statement that 
details the opinions to which each expert is expected to testify. These 
requirements may be satisfied by the incorporation of an expert’s resume or 
report containing the required information. 
c. Exhibits. A description of any physical or documentary evidence to be offered 
into evidence at the hearing. Exhibits should be identified as follows: Division 
using numbers and Denied Applicant or Respondent using letters. 
d. Stipulations. A list of all stipulations of fact or law reached, as well as a list of any 
additional stipulations requested or offered to facilitate disposition of the case. 
4. Prehearing Statements Binding. The information provided in a party’s prehearing 
statement shall be binding on that party throughout the course of the hearing unless 
modified to prevent manifest injustice. New witnesses or exhibits may be added only if: 
(1) the need to do so was not reasonably foreseeable at the time of filing of the 
prehearing statement; (2) it would not prejudice other parties; and (3) it would not 
necessitate a delay of the hearing. 
5. Consequence of Not Filing a Prehearing Statement Once a Hearing is Set. If a party does 
not timely file a prehearing statement, the hearing officer may impose appropriate 
sanctions including, but not limited to, striking proposed witnesses and exhibits.

to the hearing officer when the prehearing statement is filed. Electronic filings will be

b. Any party may move the hearing officer to seal an exhibit or order other 
appropriate relief if necessary to safeguard the confidentiality of evidence. 
5. Court Rules. 
a. To the extent practicable, the Colorado Rules of Evidence apply. Unless the 
context requires otherwise, whenever the word “court,” “judge,” or “jury” appears 
in the Colorado Rules of Evidence, such word shall be construed to mean a 
hearing officer. A hearing officer has discretion to consider evidence not 
admissible under such rules, including but not limited to hearsay evidence, 
pursuant to section 24-4-105(7), C.R.S. 
b. To the extent practicable, the Colorado Rules of Civil Procedure apply. However, 
Colorado Rules of Civil Procedure 16 and 26-37 do not apply, although parties 
are encouraged to voluntarily work together to resolve the case, simplify issues, 
and exchange information relevant to the case prior to a hearing. Unless the 
context otherwise requires, whenever the word “court” appears in a rule of civil 
procedure, that word shall be construed to mean a hearing officer.

evidence.

proponent of the order has proven its case by a preponderance of the evidence, and shall make 
written findings of evidentiary fact, ultimate conclusions of fact, conclusions of law, and a 
recommendation. These written findings shall constitute an Initial Decision subject to review by 
the State Licensing Authority pursuant to the Colorado Administrative Procedure Act and as set 
forth in Rule 8-230 – Administrative Hearing Appeals/Exceptions to Initial Decision.
