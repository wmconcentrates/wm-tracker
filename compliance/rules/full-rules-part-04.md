finds upon reasonable ascertainment of the underlying facts that the Licensee committed 
a deliberate and willful violation or there is a substantial danger to public health and 
safety and incorporates such findings into its order, it may order summary suspension of 
the Regulated Marijuana Business’s license. See Rule 8-210 – Disciplinary Process:

until the completion of the independent audit and the implementation of any required 
remedial measures.

discretion, determines that such an agreement is not in the best interests of the 
public health, safety, or welfare, then the State Licensing Authority will promptly 
institute license suspension or revocation procedures. See Rule 8-210 – 
Disciplinary Process: Summary Suspensions.
