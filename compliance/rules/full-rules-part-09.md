n Batch of wet whole plant to microbial 
contaminant testing. If during any 30-day period a Regulated Marijuana Cultivation Facility does 
not possess a HarvestProduction Batch of wet whole plant that is ready for testing, the Regulated 
Marijuana Cultivation Facility must subject its first HarvestProduction Batch of wet whole plant 
that is ready for testing to microbial contaminant testing prior to Transfer or processing of the 
Regulated Marijuana wet whole plant. If a HarvestProduction Batch of wet whole plant subject to 
ongoing contaminant testing fails contaminant testing, the Regulated Marijuana Cultivation 
Facility shall follow the procedure in subparagraph (K)(2) of this Rule. Ongoing contaminant 
testing pursuant to this Rule shall be subject to the requirements in Rule 4-225. See Rule 4-
225(A) – Collection of Test Batches. 
1. The Division may reduce the frequency of ongoing contaminant testing required if the 
Division has reasonable grounds to believe Medical Marijuana Testing Facilities and 
RetailRegulated Marijuana Testing Facilities have reached maximum capacity to perform 
testing required by this Rule. The Division will provide notification of any reduction to the 
frequency of ongoing contaminant testing to the Licensee’s last electronic mailing 
address provided to the Division. 
2. If the Licensee fails to comply with subparagraph (H) of this Rule, the Regulated 
Marijuana Cultivation Facility is no longer authorized a Reduced Testing Allowance. 
J. Regulated Marijuana Product Ongoing Potency and Homogeneity Testing. After successfully 
achieving a Reduced Testing Allowance, once per quarter a Regulated Marijuana Products 
Manufacturer shall subject at least one Production Batch of each type of Medical Marijuana 
Product or RetailRegulated Marijuana Product that it produces to potency and homogeneity 
testing required by subparagraph (D) of this Rule. If during any quarter the Regulated Marijuana 
Products Manufacturer does not possess a Production Batch that is ready for testing, the 
Licensee must subject its first Production Batch that is ready for testing to the required potency 
and homogeneity testing prior to Transfer or processing of the Regulated Marijuana. If a Test 
Batch submitted for ongoing potency and homogeneity testing fails potency and homogeneity 
testing, the Licensee shall follow the procedure in subparagraph (K) of this Rule. Ongoing 
potency and homogeneity testing pursuant to this Rule 4-210 shall be subject to the requirements 
in Rule 4-225. See Rule 4-225(A) – Collection of Test Batches.

Concentrate, or Regulated Marijuana Product unless the Harvest Batch or 
Production Batch passes all required testing. 
2. Failed Required Testing and Reduced Testing Allowance. Failed required testing may 
constitute a violation of these rules. 
a. If a Test Batch is required to be tested by these Rules or required to be tested by 
the Division pursuant to Rule 4-215(A) and fails contaminant testing, the 
Licensee shall follow the procedures in Rule 4-240 for any Inventory Tracking 
System package, Harvest Batch, or Production Batch from which the failed Test 
Batch was taken. 
b. The Licensee will not be considered qualified for a Reduced Testing Allowance 
for the required test type(s) that failed required testing. To qualify for the 
Reduced Testing Allowance again, the Licensee shall follow subparagraph (L) of 
this Rule. 
3. Failed Internal Audit or a Failed Division Inspection for Compliance with Rule 4-
230(M)(1). 
a. If a Regulated Marijuana Cultivation Facility fails an internal audit or a Division

CODE OF COLORADO REGULATIONS 1 CCR 212-3 
Marijuana Enforcement Division 
 276 
3. Failed Internal Audit or a Failed Division Inspection for Compliance. If a Licensee is 
required by these Rules to reauthorize a Reduced Testing Allowance pursuant to Rule 4-
230(K)(3), the Licensee shall submit Test Batches pursuant to Rule 4-225(B) for 
microbial contaminant testing from the next five (5) HarvestProduction Batches it 
produces. 
4. If all five (5) of the Test Batches pass required testing pursuant to Rule 4-230(L)(1) – (3), 
the Licensee will have reauthorized the Reduced Testing Allowance for the required test. 
The reauthorization tests will satisfy ongoing testing requirements for the Reduced 
Testing Allowance during the 30-day period that reauthorization testes were submitted. 
5. If any of the five (5) submitted Test Batches fails testing pursuant to Rule 4-230(L)(1) – 
(3), the Licensee will no longer have a Reduced Testing Allowance for the required test 
type(s), and the Licensee must follow the procedures in this Rule 4-230(A). 
M. Special Cases Pertaining to Reduced Testing Allowance. The following are specific additional 
considerations for Reduced Testing Allowance requirements. 
1. A Regulated Marijuana Cultivation Facility may achieve a Reduced Testing Allowance for 
microbial contaminant testing pursuant to this Rule 4-230 if the Licensee has a Hazard 
Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) System containing elements defined in 
ASTM D8250-19: “Standard Practice for Applying a Hazard Analysis Critical Control 
Points (HACCP) System for Cannabis Consumable Products” that addresses each 
product type to receive Reduced Testing Allowance for microbial contaminant testing. 
The materials incorporated by reference shall be those effective as of January 8, 2024. 
This Rule does not include any later amendments or editions to this ASTM Standard. The 
Division maintains a copy of ASTM D8250-19 at 16971707 Cole Boulevard, Suite 2300, 
Lakewood, Colorado, 80401, which is available to the public for inspection during the 
Division’s regular business hours. The pre-requisite programs requirements by the 
standard will be considered to have been met if the Regulated Marijuana Cultivation 
Facility includes documentation on how the sanitary and health requirements from Rules 
3-310 and 3-330 are implemented to ensure the hygienic and safe processing of 
consumable marijuana. This HACCP System must address biological hazards at a 
minimum and may also address additional hazards such as chemical hazards and 
physical hazards. 
a. If a Critical Control Point (CCP) is found to be outside of the Critical Limits (CLs) 
established in the HACCP plan during the production of a HarvestProduction 
Batch(es) then the HarvestProduction Batch(es) shall be submitted for microbial 
contaminant testing. For purposes of this Rule, Critical Control Point (CCP) 
means a step in the processing of Regulated Marijuana at which control can be 
applied and is essential to prevent or eliminate a safety hazard or reduce it to an 
acceptable level and shall have the same meaning as defined and used in ASTM 
Standard D8250-19, which the Division has maintained a copy and is available to 
the public for inspection. 
i. If the HarvestProduction Batch passes microbial contaminant testing, 
then there is no effect on the Reduced Testing Allowance and the 
HarvestProduction Batch may be Transferred. 
ii. If the HarvestProduction Batch fails microbial contaminant testing, then 
the Licensee shall follow subparagraph (K)(2) of this Rule to reauthorize 
the Reduced Testing Allowance for microbial contaminants. 
b. The HACCP System shall be documented as per ASTM D8250-19.6.1.12. The 
following records must be kept during the time that a Regulated Marijuana 

CODE OF COLORADO REGULATIONS 1 CCR 212-3 
Marijuana Enforcement Division 
 277 
Cultivation Facility qualifies for and maintains a Reduced Testing Allowance for 
microbial contaminants and for one year after the Reduced Testing Allowance 
expires for any reason: 
i. List of the HACCP team, including relevant experience; 
ii. Product description and intended use for each product type receiving a 
Reduced Testing Allowance for microbial contaminants; 
iii. Verified Process Flow Diagram, including Critical Control Points (CCPs); 
iv. Hazard Analysis; 
v. List of CCPs and reasoning as to how they were identified; 
vi. List of Critical Limits (CLs) and reasoning as to how they were selected; 
vii. List of Monitoring Procedures for CCPs; 
viii. List of pre-planned Corrective Actions in case of deviations; 
ix. List of verification procedures; 
x. HACCP system summary page that includes: 
A. CCPs; 
B. Critical Limits (CLs); 
C. Monitoring Procedures; 
D. Corrective Actions related to specific CCPs; 
E. Verification procedures; and 
F. Record Titles associated with the CCP activities (i.e. The Water 
Activity Monitoring Logbook, etc.); 
xi. Support documentation of the CCP validation (i.e. microbial 
contaminants testing results for Reduced Testing Allowance qualification 
and maintenance periods); and 
xii. Documents generated during operational activities related to the HACCP 
system, including at minimum: Verified Monitoring Logs for CCPs, 
Corrective and Preventive Actions documentation related to CCPs, and 
Material Changes related to HACCP system. 
2. To achieve a Reduced Testing Allowance for microbial contaminants, a Regulated 
Marijuana Cultivation Facility must conduct an internal audit to assess that they are in 
substantial compliance with the requirements of Rules 3-310, 3-330, 3-336, 4-225, 4-230, 
5-210(D), 5-210(E), 6-210(D), and 6-210(E) by achieving a passing score. This internal 
audit will be performed and scored per the rubric listed in Rule 4-230(M)(2)(a-d). A copy 
of this internal audit shall be retained as business records for one year. Internal Audit 
Scoring Rubric. The internal audit will be scored as follows: 

CODE OF COLORADO REGULATIONS 1 CCR 212-3 
Marijuana Enforcement Division 
 278 
a. Scoring System: 0% - 100% 
b. Passing Score: 80% - 100% 
c. Non-Conformance Finding Deductions: 
i. Minor: -1% 
ii. Major: -5% 
iii. Critical: -100% 
d. Definition of Non-Conformances: 
i. Minor: A deficiency in the compliance to Rule that reasonably could lead 
to a risk in product safety. 
ii. Major: A deficiency in compliance to Rule that carries a highly likely-to-
definite risk to product safety. 
iii. Critical: A clear deficiency in compliance to Rule that could lead to 
serious injury or death; or if any falsification of records is found. 
3. Attestation of Substantial Compliance with Rules. To achieve a Reduced Testing 
Allowance for Microbial Contaminants, an authorized representative of the Regulated 
Marijuana Cultivation Facility must sign an attestation that they are, to the best of their 
knowledge, in substantial compliance with Rules 3-310, 3-330, 3-336, 4-230, 5-210, and 
6-210 by achieving a passing score. A copy of this attestation shall be retained as 
business records for one year. 
N. Regulated Marijuana Concentrate Produced from Wet Whole Plant Not Tested for Microbial 
Contamination. A Regulated Marijuana Business that produces Regulated Marijuana Concentrate 
may achieve a Reduced Testing Allowance for a Regulated Marijuana Concentrate produced 
from wet whole plant that was not tested for microbial contamination, subject to the following 
requirements: 
1. Qualification Form. The Regulated Marijuana Business that produces Regulated 
Marijuana Concentrate from wet whole plant not tested for microbial contamination shall 
obtain a completed qualification form from the Regulated Marijuana Business that

C. Failed Contaminant Testing. If a Regulated Marijuana Business is notified by the Division or a 
Regulated Marijuana Testing Facility that a Test Batch failed contaminant testing, then for each 
Inventory Tracking System package, Harvest Batch, or Production Batch associated with that 
failed Test Batch the Regulated Marijuana Business must destroy, Decontaminate or Remediate 
the Batch, as described by this Rule 4-240: 
1. Destroy. Destroy and document the destruction of the Inventory Tracking System 
package, Harvest Batch or Production Batch pursuant to Rule 3-230 – Waste Disposal; 
2. Decontamination. In some special circumstances outlined below, batches may be 
Decontaminated instead of being destroyed. In those circumstances, a Licensee may 
Decontaminate the batch themselves or may Transfer the Inventory Tracking System 
package, Harvest Batch, or Production Batch that failed contaminant testing to another 
Regulated Marijuana Products Manufacturer, or Regulated Marijuana Cultivation Facility 
(except failed Solvent-Based Regulated Marijuana Concentrate, Heat/Pressure-Based 
Regulated Marijuana Concentrate, and Regulated Marijuana Product) or an Accelerator 
Manufacturer for Decontamination. 
a. For all types of Decontamination, after Decontamination has been performed on 
Regulated Marijuana, Regulated Marijuana Concentrate, or Regulated Marijuana 
Product, the Licensee must do the following: Create two new Test Batches, each 
containing the requisite number of Sample Increments, and have those Test 
Batches tested for the required contaminant test that failed. Such testing must 
comport with the sampling procedures under Rule 4-225. A Licensee shall (1) 
submit both new Test Batches to the same Regulated Marijuana Testing Facility 
that reported the original failed test result, or (2) submit the new Test Batches to 
two different Medical Marijuana Testing Facilities or RetailRegulated Marijuana 
Testing Facilities. 
i. If both retesting analyses pass the required contaminant testing, then the 
Inventory Tracking System package or HarvestProduction Batch may be 
Transferred or processed into a Regulated Marijuana Concentrate or 
Regulated Marijuana Product; 
ii. If one or both of the retesting analyses do not pass contaminant testing, 
then the Regulated Marijuana Business must either destroy and 
document the destruction of the Inventory Tracking System package or 
HarvestProduction Batch pursuant to Rule 3-230 – Waste Disposal, 
Decontaminate and test in accordance with this subparagraph (C)(2), or 
Remediate the Inventory Tracking System package or HarvestProduction 
Batch pursuant to Psubparagraph (C)(3).
