The statutory authority for this rule includes but is not limited to sections 44-10-203(1)(c), 44-10-203(1)(k), 
44-10-203(2)(d), 44-10-203(2)(g), 44-10-203(2)(h), 44-10-203(2)(i), 44-10-203(3)(c), 44-10-203(3)(e), and 
44-10-1001, C.R.S. The purpose of this rule is to clarify the minimum health and safety requirements 
imposed on a Medical or RetailRegulated Marijuana Cultivation Facility. The State Licensing Authority 

CODE OF COLORADO REGULATIONS 1 CCR 212-3 
Marijuana Enforcement Division 
 139 
has determined the cultivation of Medical or RetailRegulated Marijuana requires the application of 
processes and procedures, and the use of materials, chemicals, and pesticides which, if improperly used, 
may be potentially harmful to employees and consumers. Therefore, the cultivation of Medical or 
RetailRegulated Marijuana must be performed in a manner that reduces the likelihood of exposure to 
such materials, chemicals and pesticides, or other microbial contaminants microbials or molds. The State 
Licensing Authority intends for this rule to reduce any product contamination, which will benefit both the 
Licensees and consumers. The State Licensing Authority modeled this rule after those adopted by the 
Colorado Department Revenue for Medical Marijuana and those adopted by the Colorado Department of 
Public Health and Environment. Overall, the State Licensing Authority intends this rule to help maintain 
the integrity of Colorado’s RetailRegulated Marijuana bBusinesses and the safety of the public. 
3-330 – Cultivation of Regulated Marijuana: Specific Health and Safety Requirements 
A. Additional Sanitary Requirements. In addition to the general sanitary requirements in Rule 3-310, 
a Regulated Marijuana Cultivation Facility shall take all reasonable measure and precautions to 
ensure the following:
