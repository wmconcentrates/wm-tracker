3-800 Series – Inventory Tracking Requirements

The statutory authority for this rule includes but is not limited to sections, 44-10-201(1), 44-10-202(1)(a), 
44-10-203(1)(c), 44-10-203(1)(k), 44-10-203(2)(h), 44-10-501(1)(b), 44-10-502(2), 44-10-503(1)(b), 44-

The purpose of this rule is to establish a system that will allow the State Licensing Authority and the 
industry to jointly track Regulated Marijuana from Genetic Material stage until the Regulated Marijuana is 
sold to a patient or consumer, or destroyed. 
The Inventory Tracking System is a web-based tool coupled with RFID technology that allows both the 
Inventory Tracking System User and the State Licensing Authority the ability to identify and account for all 
Regulated Marijuana. Through the use of RFID technology, a Medical Marijuana Cultivation Facility or 
RetailRegulated Marijuana Cultivation Facility will tag either the seed or Immature Plant with an 
individualized number, which will follow the Regulated Marijuana through all phases of production and 
final sale to a patient or consumer. This will allow the State Licensing Authority and the Inventory 
Tracking System User the ability to monitor and track Regulated Marijuana inventory. The Inventory 
Tracking System will also provide a platform for the State Licensing Authority to exchange information 
and provide compliance notifications to the industry. 
The State Licensing Authority finds it essential to regulate, monitor, and track all Regulated Marijuana to 
eliminate diversion, inside and outside of the state, and to ensure that all marijuana grown, processed, 
sold, and disposed of in the Regulated Marijuana market is transparently accounted for. 

CODE OF COLORADO REGULATIONS 1 CCR 212-3 
Marijuana Enforcement Division

The State Licensing Authority will engage the industry and provide training opportunities and continue to 
evaluate the Inventory Tracking System to promote an effective means for this industry to account for and 
monitor its Regulated Marijuana inventory, which may include reevaluating the benefits of and 
alternatives to certain aspects of the current Inventory Tracking System such as RFID technology 
requirements. This Rule 3-805 was previously Rules M and R 309, 1 CCR 212-1 and 1 CCR 212-2.

provide any management change to the Division within seven days of any change, and also clarifies that 
a Licensee must save a copy of any management change report to the Division, and clarifies that failure

CODE OF COLORADO REGULATIONS 1 CCR 212-3 
Marijuana Enforcement Division 
 198 
The State Licensing Authority finds it essential to the stringent and comprehensive enforcement of the 
Marijuana Code to regulate, monitor, and track all Regulated Marijuana in order to prevent diversion and 
to ensure that all Regulated Marijuana grown, processed, sold, and disposed of in the Regulated 
Marijuana market is accounted for transparently in accordance with the Marijuana Code. 
Requiring Licensees to report instances when the Regulated Marijuana they cultivate, manufacture, 
distribute, sell, test, or dispose of is stolen, unlawfully Transferred, or otherwise diverted from the 
regulated market, or when Licensees discover plans to divert the Regulated Marijuana, emphasizes that 
Licensees are accountable for their Regulated Marijuana at all times and contributes to the transparency 
of the regulated market. 
In addition to maintaining transparency in the regulated marijuana industry, the State Licensing Authority 
also must ensure the confidentiality of certain Licensee information and records, including information in 
the Inventory Tracking System. Requiring Licensees to report instances where the Inventory Tracking 
System was compromised or planned to be compromised through unlawful access, use for unlawful 
purposes, the deliberate alteration or deletion of data, or deliberately entering false data, contributes to 
ensuring the accuracy and transparency of the system and therefore the regulated market, and aids in 
maintaining the confidentiality of Licensee data.
