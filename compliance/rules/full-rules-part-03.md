2-235 – Suitability 
A. Persons Subject to a Mandatory Finding of Suitability for Regulated Marijuana Businesses That 
Are Not Publicly Traded Corporations. 
1. Except as provided in subparagraph (A)(1)(a), any Person intending to become a 
Controlling Beneficial Owner by submitting an initial application for any Regulated 
Marijuana Business that is not a Publicly Traded Corporation must first obtain a finding of 
suitability from the State Licensing Authority. 
a. Members of the Board of Directors and Executive Officers of a Regulated 
Marijuana Business. An individual who is a Controlling Beneficial Owner because 
they are a member of the board of directors or an Executive Officer of a 
Regulated Marijuana Business or is Controlling a Regulated Marijuana Business 
but who does not possess ten percent or more of the Owner’s Interest in a 
Regulated Marijuana Business must submit a request for a finding of suitability to 
the State Licensing Authority within 45 days of becoming such a Controlling 
Beneficial Owner.

finding of suitability must include all information necessary for the State Licensing 
Authority to determine whether that Entity’s Executive Officers and any Person 
that directly or indirectly owns ten percent or more of the Owner’s Interest in the 
Regulated Marijuana Business are suitable. For example, assuming the following 
scenario, Licensee RMB LLC has one-thousand outstanding ownership interests 
and CBO 1, LLC owns 400 of those ownership interests. John Doe owns 30% of 
CBO 1, LLC. Therefore, John Doe indirectly owns 12% of the outstanding 
ownership interests of Licensee RMB LLC, and must apply to the State Licensing 
Authority for a finding of suitability. 
3. Any Person that has not received a finding of suitability and who intends to become a 
Controlling Beneficial Owner of a Regulated Marijuana Business that is not a Publicly 
Traded Corporation must submit their request for a finding of suitability prior to or 
contemporaneously with the change of owner application, unless exempt from the

controls the trust, or is positioned to receive distributions from the trust while a person 
prohibited. 
5. Any Passive Beneficial Owner who elects to apply for an Owner’s License in accordance 
with Rule 2-265(B)(3).

assuming the following scenario, Licensee PTC Inc. has one-million shares of 
outstanding Securities and CBO 1 owns 400,000 of those securities. John Doe 
owns 30% of CBO 1. Therefore, John Doe indirectly owns 12% of the

Licensing Authority for a finding of suitability. 
2. For a Controlling Beneficial Owner that is an Entity, the Entity’s request for finding of

Beneficial Owners that have already been approved in connection with ownership of the

application and may result in disciplinary action against existing license(s).

application is modified or changed after the Division approves the application, the
