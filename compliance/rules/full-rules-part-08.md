4-220 – Regulated Marijuana Testing Program: Research & Development Testing 
A. Research & Development Testing. A Regulated Marijuana Business may submit Test Batches 
from a Harvest Batch (including a Manicure Batch) or Production Batch for Research & 
Development testing. Research & Development testing may be performed for any test required by 
these 4-200 Series Rules or any other test. 
1. Harvest Batches or Production Batches that are Designated in the Inventory Tracking 
System as an Research & Development batch. 
a. The Regulated Marijuana from these batches shall not be Transferred to other 
Regulated Marijuana Businesses except for Regulated Marijuana Testing 
Facilities. 
b. Failing Research & Development test results do not require compliance with 
failed test procedures and are not considered a failing result for the purposes of 
achieving or maintaining Reduced Testing Allowance. 
2. Harvest Batches or Production Batches that are Intended to be Transferred to oOther 
Regulated Marijuana Businesses. 
a. Passing Research & Development Test Results. If a Harvest or Production Batch 
passes an Research & Development test it shall not constitute a pass for the 
purposes of compliance with required contaminant or potency testing. If a 
Harvest or Production Batch passes an Research & Development test it shall not 
constitute a pass for purposes of achieving or maintaining a Reduced Testing 
Allowance. See Rules 4-210 and 4-230. 
b. Failed Research & Development Test Results. If a Harvest or Production Batch 
fails an Research & Development test: 
i. It does not require compliance with failed test procedures. See Rule 4-
240. 
ii. If a Test Batch fails an Research & Development test that is a test type 
required by these Rules, the Licensee must submit a Test Batch from the 
same Harvest or Production Batch for compliance testing and obtain 
passing results for that test type prior to Transferring that Harvest or 
Production Batch to a Regulated Marijuana Business. 
iii. If the Test Batch submitted pursuant to subparagraph (A)(1)(b)(ii)(B) fails 
testing, compliance with the failed test procedures in Rule 4-240 is 
required. 
iv. Licensees shall not Transfer Regulated Marijuana that they have reason 
to believe would not pass testing required by Rule 4-210 and 4-215,

Colorado Constitution at Article XVIII, Subsection 16(5)(a)(VII). The purpose of this rule is to protect the 
public health and safety by establishing sampling procedures and rules for the Division’s Regulated 
Marijuana sampling and testing program. This Rule 4-225 was previously Rules 4-110 and 4-125, 1 CCR 
212-3, Rules M and R 1504, 1 CCR 212-1 and 1 CCR 212-2. 
4-225 – Regulated Marijuana Testing Program: Sampling Procedures 
A. Collection of Test Batches. 
1. Sample Increment Collection. All Test Batches submitted for testing pursuant to this Rule 
must be collected by Division representatives or in accordance with the Division’s 
sampling policy reflected in the marijuana laboratory testing reference library available at 
the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment’s website. This reference 
library may be continuously updated as new materials become available in accordance 
with section 25-1.5-106(3.5)(d), C.R.S. 
2. Sample Increment Selection. The Division may elect, at its sole direction, to assign 
Division representatives to collect Sample Increments, or may otherwise direct Sample 
Increment selection, including, but not limited to, through Division designation of a 
Harvest Batch or Production Batch in the Inventory Tracking System from which a 
Regulated Marijuana Business shall select Test Batches for testing. A Regulated 
Marijuana Business, its Controlling Beneficial Owners, Passive Beneficial Owners, and 
employees shall not attempt to influence the Sample Increments selected by Division 
representatives. If the Division does not select the Harvest Batch or Production Batch to 
be tested, a Regulated Marijuana Business must collect and submit Sample Increments 
that are representative of the Harvest Batch or Production Batch being tested. 
3. Adulteration or Alteration Prohibited. Pursuant to section 44-10-701(3)(b) and (9), C.R.S., 
it is unlawful for a Licensee or its agent to knowingly adulterate or alter, or attempt to 
adulterate or alter, any Sample Increments or Test Batches of Regulated Marijuana. The 
Sample Increments collected and submitted for testing must be representative of the 
Harvest Batch or Production Batch being tested. A person who commits adulteration or 
alteration of Sample Increments or Test Batches commits a class 2 misdemeanor and 
may be punished as provided in section 18-1.3-501, C.R.S. 
B. Timing of Sample Increments for Harvest Batches and Production Batches. A Licensee shall not 
collect Sample Increments or submit Test Batches for testing until the Harvest or Production 
Batch that is represented by the Test Batch has completed all required steps and is in its final 
form as outlined in the Standard Operating Procedures of the Licensee submitting the Test Batch, 
with the exception of packaging and labeling requirements which shall comply with Rule 3-1025. 
1. The following examples illustrate various methods, which are not limited to those listed 
herein, that a Licensee’s Standard Operating Procedures may include to verify a Test 
Batch completed all required steps and is in its final form pursuant to this Rule: 
a. The Licensee’s Standard Operating Procedures may include procedures that 
ensure the addition of all Ingredients or Additives has occurred and that the 
Harvest Batch or Production Batch associated with the Test Batch is completely 
ready to be packaged pending results of testing required by these Rules. This 
also includes creating Pre-Rolled Marijuana and Infused Pre-Rolled Marijuana; 

CODE OF COLORADO REGULATIONS 1 CCR 212-3 
Marijuana Enforcement Division 
 263 
b. For a Production Batch of Concentrate, the Licensee’s Standard Operating 
Procedure may include procedures that ensure the entire Production Batch 
associated with the Test Batch has completed all sifting, extracting, purging, 
winterizing, and steps to remove plant pigments and ensuring the addition of all 
Ingredients and Additives has occurred. 
c. For a Production Batch of Regulated Marijuana Product, the Licensee’s Standard 
Operating Procedure may include procedures that ensure the addition of all 
Ingredients and Additives has occurred and the Production Batch associated with 
the Test Batch is completely ready to be packaged pending results of testing 
required by these Rules. 
2. A Test Batch from a Harvest Batch or Production Batch shall be packaged and labeled 
according to Series 3-1025 prior to Transfer to a Regulated Marijuana Testing Facility. 
3. This Rule 4-225(B) does not apply for the submission of Test Batches submitted for 
Research & Development testing. 
4. Vaporizer Delivery Device. Retail Marijuana Concentrate that has been placed into a 
Vaporizer Delivery Device must be sampled and tested using a methodology that allows 
the laboratory to analyze the emission of the contents of the Vaporizer Delivery Device. 
C. Potency Testing – General. 
1. Test Batches. A Test Batch submitted for potency testing may only be comprised of 
Sample Increments that are of the same strain of Medical Marijuana or RetailRegulated 
Marijuana or from the same Production Batch of MedicalRegulated Marijuana 
Concentrate or MedicalRegulated Marijuana Product, or from the same Production Batch 
of Retail Marijuana Concentrate or Retail Marijuana Product, or from the same 
Production Batch of Pre-Rolled Marijuana or Infused Pre-Rolled Marijuana. 
D. Designated Test Batch Collector Training, Documentation, and Designation. 
1. Required Sample Increment Collection Training. To become a Designated Test Batch 
Collector an Owner Licensee or Employee Licensee involved in the Sample Increment 
Collection of Regulated Marijuana must be designated by a manager or Owner Licensee 
as such and must also complete either in-house training provided by the Regulated 
Marijuana Business or training from a third-party vendor including all of the topics set 
forth in subparagraph (D)(2) of this Rule. Nothing in this rule requires a Designated Test 
Batch Collector to be employed by the Regulated Marijuana Business making the 
designation. 
2. Designated Test Batch Collection Training Required Topics. The training required to 
become a Designated Test Batch Collector must include at least the following topics: 
a. Part 4–200 Series Rules - Regulated Marijuana Testing Program; 
b. The Regulated Marijuana Business's Standard Operating Procedures on creating 
a Sampleing Plan and Test Batches, and the CDPHE's Ssampling Pprocedures. 
c. “Guidance on Marijuana Sampling Procedures” Training Video or an equivalent 
training covering the following subjects: 
i. Introduction to Sample Increment Collection: 

CODE OF COLORADO REGULATIONS 1 CCR 212-3 
Marijuana Enforcement Division 
 264 
A. Cross contamination as it relates to Sample Increment 
Collection; 
B. Sample Increment Collection and how it works; 
C. Sample Increment Collection documentation and record keeping 
requirements; 
D. Penalties for Sample Increment or Test Batch adulteration or 
alteration; 
E. Use of and disinfection of the Designated Test Batch Collection 
Area; and 
F. Use of the Sample Plan. 
3. Documentation of Designated Test Batch Collector Training. Any individual receiving the 
Designated Test Batch Collector training must sign and date a document which shall be 
maintained by the Regulated Marijuana Business as a business record pursuant to Rule 
3-905. The document must acknowledge the following: 
a. The identity of the Person that created the training, such as the Regulated 
Marijuana Business or a third-party vendor; and 
b. That all required topics of the training identified in this Rule have been reviewed 
and understood by the Owner Licensee or Employee Licensee. 
E. Test Batch Collection Requirements. 
1. Required Minimum of Two Test Batch Collectors. At a minimum, two Designated Test 
Batch Collectors shall be involved in the collection of Sample Increments such that at 
least one Designated Test Batch Collector is responsible for collecting the Sample 
Increments and another Designated Test Batch Collector is responsible for reviewing 
documentation associated with the collection of Sample Increments in a timely manner 
and prior to any Transfer of the Production Batch or Harvest Batch from which Sample 
Increments were collected. This review can be completed in person or may be completed 
remotely by reviewing image(s) of the Test Batch and associated documentation. All 
Designated Test Batch Collectors must be identified as such in the Inventory Tracking 
System account associated with the Regulated Marijuana Business. 
2. Sample Plan Required. A Designated Test Batch Collector must establish a Sample Plan 
consistent with the Regulated Marijuana Business’s Standard Operating Procedure for 
Sample Increment Collection. At a minimum, a Sample Plan must include the following: 
a. The date, amount or weight, and specific location for each Sample Increment 
collected; 
b. Identification of and acknowledgements from all Designated Test Batch 
Collectors involved in the Sample Increment Collection; and 
c. If applicable, the strain name(s) for each HarvestProduction Batch from which 
Sample Increments are collected. 
F. Minimum Number of Sample Increments Per Test Batch Submission. These sampling rules shall 
apply until such time as the State Licensing Authority revises these rules to implement a 

CODE OF COLORADO REGULATIONS 1 CCR 212-3 
Marijuana Enforcement Division 
 265 
statistical sampling model. Unless a greater amount is required to comply with these rules or is 
required by a Regulated Marijuana Testing Facility to perform all requested testing, each Test 
Batch of Regulated Marijuana must contain at least the number of Sample Increments prescribed 
by this Section. 
1. A Test Batch of Regulated Marijuana must be packaged and labeled according to Rule 3-
1025. 
2. The minimum number of Sample Increments required to be collected for each Test Batch 
from a HarvestProduction Batch of Retail Marijuana or MedicalRegulated Marijuana 
flower, trim, or shake shall be determined as directed in subparagraphs (F)(4)(c)(i) 
through– (iv) of this Rule. 
3. The minimum number of Sample Increments required to be collected for each Test Batch 
from a Production Batch of Regulated Marijuana Product, Pre-Rolled Marijuana, Infused 
Pre-Rolled Marijuana, Audited Product and Alternative Use Product shall be determined 
as directed in subparagraphs (F)(4)(c)(i) through– (iv) of this Rule. 
a. The Retail Marijuana Products Manufacturer or MedicalRegulated Marijuana 
Products Manufacturer shall determine what constitutes a “Serving” and thus 
how many Servings are contained in a Production Batch of Regulated Marijuana 
Product, except that no serving of Edible Retail Marijuana Product can contain 
more than 10mg of aActive THC 
b. Because all Test Batches of Regulated Marijuana Product, Pre-Rolled Marijuana 
and Infused Pre-Rolled Marijuana are required to be submitted for testing in their 
final form, in the event the required number of Sample Increments does not 
match up within a finished package, the manufacturer must increase the number 
of Sample Increments collected for the Test Batch such that only finished 
packages of Regulated Marijuana Products, Pre-Rolled Marijuana and Infused 
Pre-Rolled Marijuana are submitted for testing. For example, if a Production 
Batch of 4000 chocolate bars is manufactured, with each bar containing 100 mg 
THC and 10 servings per bar, the Production Batch would contain 40,000 
Sample Increments which would require collection of at least 33 Sample 
Increments per Test Batch. But in this case, the manufacturer would have to 
collect 40 Sample Increments for testing (4 complete chocolate bars in final 
form). 
c. No matter how small the Production Batch of Regulated Marijuana Product, Pre-
Rolled Marijuana, and Infused Pre-Rolled Marijuana a minimum of two finished 
packages in final form must be submitted for a Test Batch. 
4. The minimum number of Sample Increments required to be collected for each Test Batch 
from a Production Batch of Retail Marijuana Concentrate or MedicalRegulated Marijuana 
Concentrate shall be determined as directed in subparagraphs (F)(4)(c)(i) through– (iv) of 
this Rule. 
a. Because all Test Batches of Retail Marijuana Concentrate and MedicalRegulated 
Marijuana Concentrate are required to be submitted for testing in their final form, 
in the event the required number of Sample Increments does not match up with 
the number of Sample Increments in a finished package, the manufacturer must 
increase the number of Sample Increments collected for the Test Batch such that 
only finished packages of Marijuana Concentrate are submitted for testing. For 
example, if a Production Batch of 4,000 Vaporizer Delivery Devices is 
manufactured, with each Vaporizer Delivery Device containing 500 milligrams of 
Marijuana Concentrate, the Production Batch would contain 2,000 grams of 

CODE OF COLORADO REGULATIONS 1 CCR 212-3 
Marijuana Enforcement Division 
 266 
Marijuana Concentrate, which would require collection of at least 15 Sample 
Increments per Test Batch. But in this case, the manufacturer would have to 
collect 16 Sample Increments for testing (8 vaporizer Delivery Devices in final 
form). 
b. No matter how small the Production Batch of Retail Marijuana Concentrate or 
MedicalRegulated Marijuana Concentrate, a minimum of two finished packages 
must be submitted for a Test Batch. 
c. Determining minimum number of Sample Increments.

B. Reduced Testing Allowance and Ongoing Testing – Contaminant Testing. 
1. Regulated Marijuana. A Regulated Marijuana Cultivation Facility’s cultivation process 
may achieve a Reduced Testing Allowance for contaminant testing if every 
HarvestProduction Batch that it produced during at least a six-week period (minimum 42 
days) but no longer than a 12-week period (maximum 84 days) passed all contaminant 
tests required by Rule 4-215(E). This must include at least six Test Batches. The period 
begins from the date of the creation of the first Harvest Batch that passed Reduced 
Testing Allowance testing. A MedicalRegulated Marijuana Cultivation Facility, a Retail 
Marijuana Cultivation Facility, or an Accelerator Cultivator can achieve a Reduced 
Testing Allowance for all contaminants listed in Rule 4-215(E) at the same time or 
separately for each contaminant. A Regulated Marijuana Cultivation Facility must 
cultivate and process all Harvest Batches or Production Batches the same way, including 
the same growing media, lighting, pesticides, and drying, trimming, and packaging 
procedures to be eligible to obtain and maintain a Reduced Testing Allowance. 
2. Regulated Marijuana Concentrate, Regulated Marijuana Product, Pre-Rolled Marijuana or 
Infused Pre-Rolled Marijuana. A Regulated Marijuana Business’s production process 
may achieve a Reduced Testing Allowance for contaminant testing if for a particular type 
of Regulated Marijuana Concentrate, Regulated Marijuana Product, or Pre-Rolled 
Marijuana or Infused Pre-Rolled Marijuana every Production Batch that it produced 
during at least a four-week period (minimum 28 days) but no longer than an eight-week 
period (maximum 56 days) passed all contaminant tests required by Rule 4-215(E). This 
must include Test Batches from at least four Production Batches. This period begins from 
the date of the creation of the first Production Batch that passed Reduced Testing 
Allowance testing. If a Regulated Marijuana Concentrate or Regulated Marijuana Product 
is manufactured using a different extraction process or infusion process or different 
hardware (such as different cartridge size, design, volume, or manufacturer) or using any 
different Additives or Botanically Derived Compounds, it will be considered a different 
type of Regulated Marijuana Concentrate or Regulated Marijuana Product and therefore 
must separately achieve a Reduced Testing Allowance. If Pre-Rolled Marijuana or 
Infused Pre-Rolled Marijuana is produced using different input materials, such as a 
different marijuana category (e.g. flower or trim), different wrapper materials, different 
processes, or different equipment, they must achieve separate Reduced Testing 
Allowances. 
C. Wet Whole Plant. A Regulated Marijuana Cultivation Facility’s cultivation process for wet whole 
plant shall be deemed acceptable for a Reduced Testing Allowance for microbial contaminant 
testing if every HarvestProduction Batch of wet whole plant that it produced during at least a 

CODE OF COLORADO REGULATIONS 1 CCR 212-3 
Marijuana Enforcement Division 
 271 
three-week (minimum 21 days) period but no longer than a 12-week (maximum 84 days) period 
passed all microbial contaminant tests required by this Rule 4-215(E). This must include at least 
six Test Batches. A MedicalRegulated Marijuana Cultivation Facility, a Retail Marijuana 
Cultivation Facility, or an Accelerator Cultivator can achieve a Reduced Testing Allowance for 
contaminants listed in this Rule 4-215(E)30 at the same time or separately for each contaminant. 
D. Reduced Testing Allowance - Potency and Homogeneity. 
1. A Retail Marijuana Products Manufacturer or Accelerator Manufacturer may achieve a 
Reduced Testing Allowance for potency and homogeneity for each type of Retail 
Marijuana Product it manufactures. 
a. For Edible Retail Marijuana Products a potency test result that is within 15 
percent of the target potency will count towards a Reduced Testing Allowance. 
i. For Edible Retail Marijuana Products that contain 2.5 milligrams of THC 
a Cannabinoid or less per serving, a potency test result that is within the 
greater of plus or minus 0.5 milligrams or 40 percent per serving will 
count towards a Reduced Testing Allowance. 
2. A Medical Marijuana Products Manufacturer may achieve a Reduced Testing Allowance 
for potency and homogeneity for each type of non-Edible Medical Marijuana Product and 
each type of Edible Medical Marijuana Product that it manufactures. 
a. For Edible Medical Marijuana Products that contain 100 milligrams of THC or 
less per Container, a potency test result that is within 15 percent of the target 
potency will count towards a Reduced Testing Allowance. 
i. For Edible Medical Marijuana Products that contain 2.5 milligrams of 
THC a Cannabinoid or less per serving and 100 milligrams of THC or 
less per Container, a potency test result that is within the greater of plus 
or minus 0.5 milligrams or 40 percent per serving will count towards a 
Reduced Testing Allowance. 
b. For Edible Medical Marijuana Products that contain between 101 and 500 
milligrams of THC per Container, a potency test result that is within 10 percent of 
the target potency will count towards a Reduced Testing Allowance. 
c. For Edible Medical Marijuana Products that contain 501 milligrams of THC or 
more per Container, a potency test result that is within 5 percent of the target 
potency will count towards a Reduced Testing Allowance. 
3. A Regulated Marijuana Products Manufacturer’s production process for a particular type 
of Regulated Marijuana Product shall be deemed acceptable for a Reduced Testing 
Allowance for potency and homogeneity testing if every Production Batch that it produces 
for that particular type of Regulated Marijuana Product during at least a four-week period 
but no longer than an eight-week period passes all potency and homogeneity tests 
required by Rule 4-210. This must include at least four Test Batches. 
E. Expiration of a Reduced Testing Allowance. Once a Regulated Marijuana Business has 
successfully achieved Reduced Testing Allowance for any contaminants listed in Rule 4-215 or 
Potency as required by 4-210(E), Reduced Testing Allowance is effective for one year from the 
date of the first passing Harvest Batch or Production Batch. One year is equal to 365 days 
inclusive, or 366 days inclusive during a leap year. When the Reduced Testing Allowance 

CODE OF COLORADO REGULATIONS 1 CCR 212-3 
Marijuana Enforcement Division 
 272 
expires, the Regulated Marijuana Business shall achieve new Reduced Testing Allowance or 
Perform all testing Required by 4-210 and 4-215. 
F. Reduced Testing Allowance Certification Fee. A Licensee seeking to obtain Reduced Testing 
Allowance must first pay the fee in Rule 2-140(A). 
1. A Licensee who chooses to pay the Reduced Testing Allowance fee must also submit an 
attestation form that at a minimum requires the Licensee attest they understand these 
testing Rules and requirements. 
2. Upon the Division’s receipt of payment of the fee and submission of the attestation form, 
a Licensee may exercise the privileges of Reduced Testing Allowance for a 12-month 
period. 
3. If a Licensee is required, under these Rules, to reauthorize the Reduced Testing 
Allowance within the 12-month period, the Licensee is not required to pay a new fee. 
4. Reduced Testing Allowance Certification can be renewed annually.

Note: If during any period of ongoing testing specified in the table above the Regulated Marijuana 
Business does not possess a Harvest Batch or Production Batch that is ready for testing, the Regulated 
Marijuana Business must subject its first Harvest Batch or Production Batch that is ready for testing to the 
required contaminant testing prior to Transfer or processing of the Regulated Marijuana, Regulated 
Marijuana Product, Pre-Rolled Marijuana, and Infused Pre-Rolled Marijuana. 
H. Regulated Marijuana Ongoing Contaminant Testing. After successfully achieving a Reduced 
Testing Allowance, a Regulated Marijuana Business shall subject at least one HarvestProduction 
Batch to all contaminant testing required by Rule 4-215(E) once every 30-day period following the 
test submission date of the last Test Batch used to achieve the Reduced Testing Allowance. If 
during any 30-day period the Regulated Marijuana Business does not possess a 
HarvestProduction Batch that is ready for testing, the Regulated Marijuana Business must subject 
its first HarvestProduction Batch that is ready for testing to the required contaminant testing prior 
to Transfer or processing of the Regulated Marijuana. If a HarvestProduction Batch subject to 
ongoing contaminant testing fails contaminant testing, the Regulated Marijuana Business shall 

CODE OF COLORADO REGULATIONS 1 CCR 212-3 
Marijuana Enforcement Division 
 273 
follow the procedure in subparagraph (K)(2) of this Rule. Ongoing contaminant testing pursuant to 
this Rule 4-230 shall be subject to the requirements in Rule 4-225. See Rule 4-225(A) – 
Collection of Test Batches. 
1. The Division may reduce the frequency of ongoing contaminant testing required if the 
Division has reasonable grounds to believe Medical Marijuana Testing Facilities and 
RetailRegulated Marijuana Testing Facilities have reached maximum capacity to perform 
testing required by this Rule. The Division will provide notification of any reduction to the 
frequency of ongoing contaminant testing to the Licensee’s last electronic mailing 
address provided to the Division. 
2. If the Licensee fails to comply with subparagraph (H) of this Rule, the Regulated 
Marijuana Business is no longer authorized a Reduced Testing Allowance. 
3. Visual Microbial Growth - Regulated Marijuana. If a Regulated Marijuana Cultivation 
Facility is aware that a HarvestProduction Batch contains visual microbial contamination, 
the Regulated Marijuana Cultivation Facility shall subject the HarvestProduction Batch to 
microbial contaminant testing pursuant to Rule 4-215(E). If the Test Batch fails testing, 
then the HarvestProduction Batch shall be subject to the requirements in Rule 4-240(C). 
The Licensees must also follow subparagraph (K)(2) of this Rule. 
I. Regulated Marijuana Ongoing Contaminant Testing – Wet Whole Plant. After successfully 
achieving a Reduced Testing Allowance, once every 30 days a Regulated Marijuana Cultivation 
Facility shall subject at least one HarvestProductio
