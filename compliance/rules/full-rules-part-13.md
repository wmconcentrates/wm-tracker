C. Possession of Other Categories of Retail Marijuana Concentrate. 
1. It shall be considered a violation of this Rule if a Retail Marijuana Cultivation Facility

Products Manufacturer license; or the Retail Marijuana Cultivation Facility has been 
issued a Centralized Distribution Permit and is in possession of the Retail Marijuana 
Concentrate in compliance with Rule 6-205(I). 
2. Notwithstanding subparagraph (C)(1) of this Rule 6-215, a Retail Marijuana Cultivation

Basis and Purpose – 6-220 
The statutory authority for this rule includes but is not limited to sections 44-10-202(1)(c), 44-10-203(1)(c), 
44-10-203(1)(k), 44-10-203(2)(aa), 44-10-203(6), 44-10-401(2)(b)(II), 44-10-401(2)(b)(VII),and 44-10-602, 
and 44-10-607, C.R.S. The rule establishes a means by which to manage the overall production of Retail 
Marijuana in the state of Colorado. The intent of this rule is to encourage responsible production to meet 
demand for retail marijuana consumers, while also avoiding overproduction or underproduction. The 

CODE OF COLORADO REGULATIONS 1 CCR 212-3 
Marijuana Enforcement Division 
 404 
establishment of production management is necessary to ensure there is not significant under or over 
production, either of which will increase incentives to engage in diversion and facilitate the continuation of 
the sale of illegal marijuana. 
Existing and prospective Licensees should be on notice that the new or revised regulations may impact 
the production limits provided for in this rule. Additionally, throughout the rulemaking process 
stakeholders expressed concern over ensuring an adequate amount of licensed Retail Marijuana Stores 
exist to sell the amount of Retail Marijuana being produced at licensed Retail Marijuana Cultivation 
Facilities. Scaling the number of interests a Person may hold in Retail Marijuana Cultivation Facility 
licenses relative to the number of controlling interests the Person has in Retail Marijuana Store(s) has 
been incorporated in the production management rules as a means to address this production 
management concern. 
Theis Rule 6-220 was previously Rule R 506, 1 CCR 212-2, and includes provisions previously reflected 
in Rule 6-720, 1 CCR 212-3.

increase one tier or one increment of 3,600 plants if already a tier 5 or

or after an investigation. Based on the Division’s review, the Division may reduce the Licensee’s 
maximum allowed plant count to a lower production management tier pursuant to subparagraph

Industrial Hygienist or Professional Engineer; 
7. Ensure that the appropriate safety and sanitary equipment, including personal protective 
equipment, is provided to, and appropriately used by, each Owner Licensee or Employee 
Licensee engaged in the production of a Solvent-Based Retail Marijuana Concentrate; 
and 
8. Ensure that a trained Owner Licensee or Employee Licensee is present at all times 
during the production of a Solvent-Based Retail Marijuana Concentrate whenever an 
extraction process requires the use of pressurized equipment. 
9. Retail Marijuana Products Manufacturers Engaged in the Remediation of Retail 
Marijuana for elemental impurities. Retail Marijuana Products Manufacturers engaged in 
the Remediation of Retail Marijuana for elemental impurities shall: 
a. Implement effective cleaning procedures, additional testing plans, and other 
measures that will be performed to prevent cross contamination. 
i. If potentially contaminated equipment, ingredients, or solvents used in 
the Remediation process are used for processing other ‘non remediated’ 
material, the subsequent Production Batch made using the equipment, 
ingredients, or solvent must then be tested for elemental impurities, and 
the Production Batch made using that equipment, ingredients, or 
solvents is not eligible for a Reduced Testing Allowance or otherwise 
exempt from required testing. 
ii. Manufacturers must document the equipment and lots of 
ingredients/solvents used in Remediation to ensure this requirement is 
met. 
b. Register as a hazardous waste generator, obtain a U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency ID number for manifesting hazardous waste, and must have a 
disposal contract in place with a hazardous waste management company prior to 
attempting Remediation. 
c. Have a staff member who has received basic training in hazardous waste 
identification, storage, and disposal procedures, or hire a consultant who satisfies 
these criteria. 
d. Regardless of which type of analyte, if the Retail Marijuana flower, wet whole 
plant, or trim has failed elemental impurities, the Licensee must implement 
Standard Operating Procedures to ensure: 
i. That contaminated material is stored in a labelled container identifying 
the material as potentially hazardous, and that the container seals in 

CODE OF COLORADO REGULATIONS 1 CCR 212-3 
Marijuana Enforcement Division 
 430 
such a way to prevent the risk of cross contamination or inhalation of 
dusts. 
ii. That when material is removed from the sealed container and handled in 
any fashion (preparation, the extraction or other Remediation process, 
wasting, etc.), any workers exposed to dusts or particulates generated 
from the material must wear appropriate personal protective equipment 
(PPE), including at minimum: gloves, American National Standards 
Institute (ANSI) Z87.1 safety glasses, and a respirator rated to protect 
them from airborne dusts or particulates that may contain elemental 
impurities. Respirators should utilize National Institute for Occupational 
Safety and Health rated particulate filters of sufficient grade to prevent 
exposure to airborne dusts that could contain elemental impurities. 
A. Workers utilizing a respirator must comply with applicable 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations 
regarding respirator use before handling contaminated material. 
This includes receiving respirator clearance from a qualified 
professional and passing a respirator fit test before using a 
respirator. 
e. Additional forms of environmental airborne particulate control, such as industrial 
air filtration systems, handling material inside of enclosures, etc. must be 
implemented by the Licensee to minimize the risk of exposure or cross 
contamination of contaminated dusts. 
f. These steps must be documented in the Licensee’s respiratory protection 
program that all employees exposed to plant material or waste products 
contaminated with the elemental impurities must be trained on. 
g. The Licensee must establish and train employees on SOPs designed to safely 
handle this contaminated material and prevent cross contamination. 
h. Mercury poses additional workplaces hazards since it is easily volatilized and 
since mercury vapor is highly toxic. Before attempting to remediate any 
Regulated Marijuana flower, wet whole plant, or trim that has failed elemental 
impurities testing and contains mercury, Licensees must additionally: 
i. Work with a certified industrial hygienist to develop and implement some 
form of monitoring program that is capable of detecting mercury vapor 
concentrations in the areas where material contaminated with mercury 
will be processed and can be used to generate time weighted average 
exposures to mercury vapor. The monitoring system must be sufficient to 
ensure airborne concentrations of mercury do not exceed Occupational 
Safety and Health Administration Permissible Exposure Limits for 
Airborne Contaminants. 
ii. Have a certified industrial hygienist approve the Licensee’s air handling 
system for managing mercury vapors in a fashion that is compliant with 
the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and other applicable 
federal, state, and local regulations. 
iii. Utilize a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health rated half 
mask respirator with cartridges rated specifically for mercury vapor. 

CODE OF COLORADO REGULATIONS 1 CCR 212-3 
Marijuana Enforcement Division

material as potentially hazardous, and that the container seals in such a way to 
prevent the risk of cross contamination or inhalation of dusts. 
c. Ensure that when material is removed from the sealed container and handled in 
any fashion (preparation, the extraction or other Remediation p
