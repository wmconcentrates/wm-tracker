The Retail Marijuana Products Manufacturer or MedicalRegulated Marijuana Products Manufacturer shall determine what constitutes a “Serving” and thus how many Servings are contained in a Production Batch of Regulated Marijuana Product, except that no serving of Edible Retail Marijuana Product can contain more than 10mg of aActive THC b. Because all Test Batches of Regulated Marijuana Product, Pre-Rolled Marijuana and Infused Pre-Rolled Marijuana are required to be submitted for testing in their final form, in the event the required number of Sample Increments does not match up within a finished package, the manufacturer must increase the number of Sample Increments collected for the Test Batch such that only finished packages of Regulated Marijuana Products, Pre-Rolled Marijuana and Infused Pre-Rolled Marijuana are submitted for testing. For example, if a Production Batch of 4000 chocolate bars is manufactured, with each bar containing 100 mg THC and 10 servings per bar, the Production Batch would contain 40,000 Sample Increments which would require collection of at least 33 Sample Increments per Test Batch. But in this case, the manufacturer would have to collect 40 Sample Increments for testing (4 complete chocolate bars in final form). c. No matter how small the Production Batch of Regulated Marijuana Product, Pre- Rolled Marijuana, and Infused Pre-Rolled Marijuana a minimum of two finished packages in final form must be submitted for a Test Batch. 4. The minimum number of Sample Increments required to be collected for each Test Batch from a Production Batch of Retail Marijuana Concentrate or MedicalRegulated Marijuana Concentrate shall be determined as directed in subparagraphs (F)(4)(c)(i) through– (iv) of this Rule. a. Because all Test Batches of Retail Marijuana Concentrate and MedicalRegulated Marijuana Concentrate are required to be submitted for testing in their final form, in the event the required number of Sample Increments does not match up with the number of Sample Increments in a finished package, the manufacturer must increase the number of Sample Increments collected for the Test Batch such that only finished packages of Marijuana Concentrate are submitted for testing. For example, if a Production Batch of 4,000 Vaporizer Delivery Devices is manufactured, with each Vaporizer Delivery Device containing 500 milligrams of Marijuana Concentrate, the Production Batch would contain 2,000 grams of CODE OF COLORADO REGULATIONS 1 CCR 212-3 Marijuana Enforcement Division 266 Marijuana Concentrate, which would require collection of at least 15 Sample Increments per Test Batch. But in this case, the manufacturer would have to collect 16 Sample Increments for testing (8 vaporizer Delivery Devices in final form). b. No matter how small the Production Batch of Retail Marijuana Concentrate or MedicalRegulated Marijuana Concentrate, a minimum of two finished packages must be submitted for a Test Batch. c. Determining minimum number of Sample Increments. i. The following table represents Regulated Marijuana Sample Increments of 0.5 grams:","The written procedures shall include requirements, as appropriate, for:  1.

Reduced Testing Allowance and Ongoing Testing – Contaminant Testing. 1. Regulated Marijuana. A Regulated Marijuana Cultivation Facility’s cultivation process may achieve a Reduced Testing Allowance for contaminant testing if every HarvestProduction Batch that it produced during at least a six-week period (minimum 42 days) but no longer than a 12-week period (maximum 84 days) passed all contaminant tests required by Rule 4-215(E). This must include at least six Test Batches. The period begins from the date of the creation of the first Harvest Batch that passed Reduced Testing Allowance testing. A MedicalRegulated Marijuana Cultivation Facility, a Retail Marijuana Cultivation Facility, or an Accelerator Cultivator can achieve a Reduced Testing Allowance for all contaminants listed in Rule 4-215(E) at the same time or separately for each contaminant. A Regulated Marijuana Cultivation Facility must cultivate and process all Harvest Batches or Production Batches the same way, including the same growing media, lighting, pesticides, and drying, trimming, and packaging procedures to be eligible to obtain and maintain a Reduced Testing Allowance. 2. Regulated Marijuana Concentrate, Regulated Marijuana Product, Pre-Rolled Marijuana or Infused Pre-Rolled Marijuana. A Regulated Marijuana Business’s production process may achieve a Reduced Testing Allowance for contaminant testing if for a particular type of Regulated Marijuana Concentrate, Regulated Marijuana Product, or Pre-Rolled Marijuana or Infused Pre-Rolled Marijuana every Production Batch that it produced during at least a four-week period (minimum 28 days) but no longer than an eight-week period (maximum 56 days) passed all contaminant tests required by Rule 4-215(E). This must include Test Batches from at least four Production Batches. This period begins from the date of the creation of the first Production Batch that passed Reduced Testing Allowance testing. If a Regulated Marijuana Concentrate or Regulated Marijuana Product is manufactured using a different extraction process or infusion process or different hardware (such as different cartridge size, design, volume, or manufacturer) or using any different Additives or Botanically Derived Compounds, it will be considered a different type of Regulated Marijuana Concentrate or Regulated Marijuana Product and therefore must separately achieve a Reduced Testing Allowance. If Pre-Rolled Marijuana or Infused Pre-Rolled Marijuana is produced using different input materials, such as a different marijuana category (e.g. flower or trim), different wrapper materials, different processes, or different equipment, they must achieve separate Reduced Testing Allowances. C. Wet Whole Plant. A Regulated Marijuana Cultivation Facility’s cultivation process for wet whole plant shall be deemed acceptable for a Reduced Testing Allowance for microbial contaminant testing if every HarvestProduction Batch of wet whole plant that it produced during at least a CODE OF COLORADO REGULATIONS 1 CCR 212-3 Marijuana Enforcement Division 271 three-week (minimum 21 days) period but no longer than a 12-week (maximum 84 days) period passed all microbial contaminant tests required by this Rule 4-215(E). This must include at least six Test Batches. A MedicalRegulated Marijuana Cultivation Facility, a Retail Marijuana Cultivation Facility, or an Accelerator Cultivator can achieve a Reduced Testing Allowance for contaminants listed in this Rule 4-215(E)30 at the same time or separately for each contaminant. D. Reduced Testing Allowance - Potency and Homogeneity. 1. A Retail Marijuana Products Manufacturer or Accelerator Manufacturer may achieve a Reduced Testing Allowance for potency and homogeneity for each type of Retail Marijuana Product it manufactures. a. For Edible Retail Marijuana Products a potency test result that is within 15 percent of the target potency will count towards a Reduced Testing Allowance. i. For Edible Retail Marijuana Products that contain 2.5 milligrams of THC a Cannabinoid or less per serving, a potency test result that is within the greater of plus or minus 0.5 milligrams or 40 percent per serving will count towards a Reduced Testing Allowance. 2. A Medical Marijuana Products Manufacturer may achieve a Reduced Testing Allowance for potency and homogeneity for each type of non-Edible Medical Marijuana Product and each type of Edible Medical Marijuana Product that it manufactures. a. For Edible Medical Marijuana Products that contain 100 milligrams of THC or less per Container, a potency test result that is within 15 percent of the target potency will count towards a Reduced Testing Allowance. i. For Edible Medical Marijuana Products that contain 2.5 milligrams of THC a Cannabinoid or less per serving and 100 milligrams of THC or less per Container, a potency test result that is within the greater of plus or minus 0.5 milligrams or 40 percent per serving will count towards a Reduced Testing Allowance. b. For Edible Medical Marijuana Products that contain between 101 and 500 milligrams of THC per Container, a potency test result that is within 10 percent of the target potency will count towards a Reduced Testing Allowance. c. For Edible Medical Marijuana Products that contain 501 milligrams of THC or more per Container, a potency test result that is within 5 percent of the target potency will count towards a Reduced Testing Allowance. 3. A Regulated Marijuana Products Manufacturer’s production process for a particular type of Regulated Marijuana Product shall be deemed acceptable for a Reduced Testing Allowance for potency and homogeneity testing if every Production Batch that it produces for that particular type of Regulated Marijuana Product during at least a four-week period but no longer than an eight-week period passes all potency and homogeneity tests required by Rule 4-210. This must include at least four Test Batches. E. Expiration of a Reduced Testing Allowance. Once a Regulated Marijuana Business has successfully achieved Reduced Testing Allowance for any contaminants listed in Rule 4-215 or Potency as required by 4-210(E), Reduced Testing Allowance is effective for one year from the date of the first passing Harvest Batch or Production Batch. One year is equal to 365 days inclusive, or 366 days inclusive during a leap year. When the Reduced Testing Allowance CODE OF COLORADO REGULATIONS 1 CCR 212-3 Marijuana Enforcement Division 272 expires, the Regulated Marijuana Business shall achieve new Reduced Testing Allowance or Perform all testing Required by 4-210 and 4-215. F. Reduced Testing Allowance Certification Fee. A Licensee seeking to obtain Reduced Testing Allowance must first pay the fee in Rule 2-140(A). 1. A Licensee who chooses to pay the Reduced Testing Allowance fee must also submit an attestation form that at a minimum requires the Licensee attest they understand these testing Rules and requirements. 2. Upon the Division’s receipt of payment of the fee and submission of the attestation form, a Licensee may exercise the privileges of Reduced Testing Allowance for a 12-month period. 3. If a Licensee is required, under these Rules, to reauthorize the Reduced Testing Allowance within the 12-month period, the Licensee is not required to pay a new fee. 4.

Applicants and Licensees Shall Cooperate with Division Employees. 1. Applicants and Licensees must cooperate with employees of the Division who are conducting inspections or investigations relevant to the enforcement of laws and regulations related to the Marijuana Code. 2. No Applicant or Licensee shall by any means interfere with, obstruct, or impede the State Licensing Authority or any employee of the Division from exercising their duties pursuant to the provisions of the Marijuana Code and all rules promulgated pursuant to it. This would include, but is not limited to: a. Threatening force or violence against an employee or investigator of the Division, or otherwise endeavoring to intimidate, obstruct, or impede employees or investigators of the Division, their supervisors, or any peace officers from exercising their duties. The term “threatening force” includes the threat of bodily harm to such individual or to a member of his or her family; b.

To prevent destruction of evidence, diversion, or other threats to public safety, while permitting a Licensee to retain its inventory pending further investigation of an alleged violation of the Marijuana Code or Marijuana Rules, a Division investigator may order an administrative hold of Regulated Marijuana pursuant to the following procedure: a. If during an investigation or inspection of a Licensee, a Division investigator develops objective and reasonable grounds to believe certain Regulated CODE OF COLORADO REGULATIONS 1 CCR 212-3 Marijuana Enforcement Division 537 Marijuana constitute evidence of acts in violation of the Marijuana Code or Marijuana Rules, or constitute a threat to the public safety, the Division investigator may issue a notice of administrative hold of any such Regulated Marijuana pending further investigation of an alleged violation of the Marijuana Code or Marijuana Rules. The notice of administrative hold shall provide a documented description of the Regulated Marijuana to be subject to the administrative hold . Following the issuance of a notice of administrative hold, the Division will identify the Regulated Marijuana subject to the administrative hold in the Inventory Tracking System. The Licensee shall continue to comply with all tracking requirements. See Rule 3-805 – Regulated Marijuana Businesses: Inventory Tracking System. b. The Senior Director, or their designee, shall promptly approve and issue a concise statement regarding the reasons for issuing the administrative hold and outlining the estimated time required to complete the investigation. The estimated time required to complete the investigation is not binding and may be adjusted at any time. If the estimated time is adjusted, the Division will provide the Licensee written notice. 2. The Licensee shall completely and physically segregate the Regulated Marijuana subject to the administrative hold in a Limited Access Area of the Licensed Premises under investigation, where it shall be safeguarded by the Licensee. a. While the administrative hold is in effect, the Licensee is prohibited from, giving away, Transferring, transporting, or destroying the Regulated Marijuana subject to the administrative hold, except as otherwise authorized by these rules. b. While the administrative hold is in effect, the Licensee must safeguard the Regulated Marijuana subject to the administrative hold, must maintain the Licensed Premises in reasonable condition according to health, safety, and sanitary standards, and must fully comply with all security requirements including but not limited to video surveillance, lock and alarm requirements as set forth in the Marijuana Code and the Marijuana Rules . c.

Lift, Expiration, or Extension of Administrative Hold. a. At any time after the initiation of the administrative hold, the administrative hold may be lifted by order of the State Licensing Authority or a Division Investigator, or by agreement between the State Licensing Authority and the Licensee subject to the administrative hold. If a Division investigator determines to lift the CODE OF COLORADO REGULATIONS 1 CCR 212-3 Marijuana Enforcement Division 538 administrative hold, the investigator will send the Licensee written notification of the reason the administrative hold is being lifted. b. At any time after the initiation of the administrative hold, the State Licensing Authority may lift, revise, or extend the administrative hold. c. An administrative hold expires after 120 days unless an administrative action has been initiated concerning the Regulated Marijuana subject to the administrative hold, or the State Licensing Authority extends the administrative hold. d. The State Licensing Authority’s order to extend the administrative hold will identify the reasons for extending the administrative hold. The State Licensing Authority will only consider the following factors when deciding whether to extend an administrative hold: i. The need to preserve evidence for a pending administrative action; ii. The existence of a new or continued threat of diversion; iii. The existence of a new or continued threat of public safety; iv. The Licensee’s failure to cooperate with Division investigators; v. The Licensee’s failure to maintain security and inventory controls, including record keeping and inventory tracking requirements, video surveillance, Security Alarm System, or lock requirements; vi. The Licensee’s failure to maintain all required state or local licenses; or vii. The Licensee’s current tax noncompliance. B.5. Embargo. 1. Notice of Embargo. a. The Division may embargo Regulated Marijuana when there are objective and reasonable grounds to believe the Regulated Marijuana poses a risk to health, safety, or welfare of the public that imperatively requires emergency action. b. A Division investigator will issue a Notice of Embargo to only the Licensee from which the Regulated Marijuana originated including a description of the Regulated Marijuana and identifying any permitted activities regarding the Regulated Marijuana subject to the embargo. Following the issuance of a Notice of Embargo, the Division will identify the Regulated Marijuana subject to embargo in the Inventory Tracking System. The Licensee shall issue a recall pursuant to Rule 3-336 for Regulated Marijuana subject to an embargo. The recall can only be terminated with approval of the Division. With approval from the Division, a Licensee subject to the Notice of Embargo may instruct other Licensees to destroy the affected Regulated Marijuana as part of the recall. The Division may also notify Licensees that received the embargoed Regulated Marijuana of the embargo and requirement that the Regulated Marijuana be physically segregated. The Licensee shall continue to comply with all tracking requirements. See Rule 3-805 – Regulated Marijuana Businesses: Inventory Tracking System. CODE OF COLORADO REGULATIONS 1 CCR 212-3 Marijuana Enforcement Division 539 c. The Senior Director, or their designee, shall promptly approve and issue a concise statement regarding the reasons for issuing the embargo. 2. The Effect of Embargo. a. The Licensee shall completely and physically segregate the Regulated Marijuana subject to the embargo in a Limited Access Area of the Licensed Premises. b. While the embargo is in effect, the Licensee is prohibited from Transferring, or transporting the Regulated Marijuana subject to the embargo, except as otherwise authorized by this Rule 8-110. The Licensee can choose to destroy the Regulated Marijuana that is the subject of the embargo at its expense, with advance approval from and in coordination with the Division and in accordance with Rule 3-230 – Waste Disposal. c. While the embargo is in effect, the Licensee must safeguard the Regulated Marijuana subject to the embargo, must maintain the Licensed Premises in reasonable condition according to health, safety, and sanitary standards, and must fully comply with all security requirements including but not limited to video surveillance, lock and alarm requirements as set forth in the Marijuana Rules. 3. Release, Destruction, and Opportunity for Hearing. a. At any time after service of a Notice of Embargo, the Division or the State Licensing Authority may lift, revise, or extend the embargo by agreement between the Division or the State Licensing Authority and the Licensee subject to the embargo. b. If a Notice of Destruction has not been issued after 120 days of the Notice of Embargo, the Licensee that received the Notice of Embargo from the Division investigator may submit a written request for a hearing before a Department of Revenue Hearing Officer. The issue at the hearing will be whether there are reasonable grounds to support that the Regulated Marijuana poses a risk to public health or safety and should be subject to destruction, should be subject to continued embargo, or does not pose a risk to public health and safety and should be released from the embargo. c. Within 60 days of receiving a Notice of Destruction, the Licensee receiving the Notice of Destruction may request a hearing pursuant to Rule 8-220(B). Failure to request a hearing within the 60-day time period automatically results in the Notice of Destruction becoming an order of destruction. d. If the Licensee receiving the Notice of Destruction requests a hearing, the hearing will be conducted by a Department of Revenue Hearing Officer pursuant to section 24-4-105, C.R.S. The sole issue at the hearing will be whether the Regulated Marijuana subject to the embargo poses a threat to the health, safety, or welfare of the public and therefore should be destroyed. Following the hearing, the Hearing Officer will issue an Initial Decision that is subject to exceptions and judicial review. e. If a destruction is ordered pursuant to this Rule 8-110(B.5)(3), the Licensee that received the Notice of Destruction is responsible for completing the destruction in coordination with the Division and in accordance with the Marijuana Rules. The Licensee receiving the Notice of Destruction is also responsible for all expenses related to the embargo and destruction of Regulated Marijuana. CODE OF COLORADO REGULATIONS 1 CCR 212-3 Marijuana Enforcement Division 540 4.

The following examples illustrate various methods, which are not limited to those listed \nherein, that a Licensee’s Standard Operating Procedures may include to verify a Test \nBatch completed all required steps and is in its final form pursuant to this Rule: \na. The Licensee’s Standard Operating Procedures may include procedures that \nensure the addition of all Ingredients or Additives has occurred and that the \nHarvest Batch or Production Batch associated with the Test Batch is completely \nready to be packaged pending results of testing required by these Rules. This \nalso includes creating Pre-Rolled Marijuana and Infused Pre-Rolled Marijuana; \n\nCODE OF COLORADO REGULATIONS 1 CCR 212-3 \nMarijuana Enforcement Division \n 263 \nb. For a Production Batch of Concentrate, the Licensee’s Standard Operating \nProcedure may include procedures that ensure the entire Production Batch \nassociated with the Test Batch has completed all sifting, extracting, purging, \nwinterizing, and steps to remove plant pigments and ensuring the addition of all \nIngredients and Additives has occurred. \nc. For a Production Batch of Regulated Marijuana Product, the Licensee’s Standard \nOperating Procedure may include procedures that ensure the addition of all \nIngredients and Additives has occurred and the Production Batch associated with \nthe Test Batch is completely ready to be packaged pending results of testing \nrequired by these Rules. \n2. A Test Batch from a Harvest Batch or Production Batch shall be packaged and labeled \naccording to Series 3-1025 prior to Transfer to a Regulated Marijuana Testing Facility. \n3. This Rule 4-225(B) does not apply for the submission of Test Batches submitted for \nResearch & Development testing. \n4. Vaporizer Delivery Device. Retail Marijuana Concentrate that has been placed into a \nVaporizer Delivery Device must be sampled and tested using a methodology that allows \nthe laboratory to analyze the emission of the contents of the Vaporizer Delivery Device. \nC. Potency Testing – General. \n1. Test Batches. A Test Batch submitted for potency testing may only be comprised of \nSample Increments that are of the same strain of Medical Marijuana or RetailRegulated \nMarijuana or from the same Production Batch of MedicalRegulated Marijuana \nConcentrate or MedicalRegulated Marijuana Product, or from the same Production Batch \nof Retail Marijuana Concentrate or Retail Marijuana Product, or from the same \nProduction Batch of Pre-Rolled Marijuana or Infused Pre-Rolled Marijuana. \nD. Designated Test Batch Collector Training, Documentation, and Designation. \n1. Required Sample Increment Collection Training. To become a Designated Test Batch \nCollector an Owner Licensee or Employee Licensee involved in the Sample Increment \nCollection of Regulated Marijuana must be designated by a manager or Owner Licensee \nas such and must also complete either in-house training provided by the Regulated \nMarijuana Business or training from a third-party vendor including all of the topics set \nforth in subparagraph (D)(2) of this Rule.

That all required topics of the training identified in this Rule have been reviewed \nand understood by the Owner Licensee or Employee Licensee. \nE. Test Batch Collection Requirements. \n1. Required Minimum of Two Test Batch Collectors. At a minimum, two Designated Test \nBatch Collectors shall be involved in the collection of Sample Increments such that at \nleast one Designated Test Batch Collector is responsible for collecting the Sample \nIncrements and another Designated Test Batch Collector is responsible for reviewing \ndocumentation associated with the collection of Sample Increments in a timely manner \nand prior to any Transfer of the Production Batch or Harvest Batch from which Sample \nIncrements were collected. This review can be completed in person or may be completed \nremotely by reviewing image(s) of the Test Batch and associated documentation. All \nDesignated Test Batch Collectors must be identified as such in the Inventory Tracking \nSystem account associated with the Regulated Marijuana Business. \n2. Sample Plan Required. A Designated Test Batch Collector must establish a Sample Plan \nconsistent with the Regulated Marijuana Business’s Standard Operating Procedure for \nSample Increment Collection. At a minimum, a Sample Plan must include the following: \na. The date, amount or weight, and specific location for each Sample Increment \ncollected; \nb. Identification of and acknowledgements from all Designated Test Batch \nCollectors involved in the Sample Increment Collection; and \nc. If applicable, the strain name(s) for each HarvestProduction Batch from which \nSample Increments are collected. \nF. Minimum Number of Sample Increments Per Test Batch Submission.

Unless a greater amount is required to comply with these rules or is \nrequired by a Regulated Marijuana Testing Facility to perform all requested testing, each Test \nBatch of Regulated Marijuana must contain at least the number of Sample Increments prescribed \nby this Section. \n1. A Test Batch of Regulated Marijuana must be packaged and labeled according to Rule 3-\n1025. \n2. The minimum number of Sample Increments required to be collected for each Test Batch \nfrom a HarvestProduction Batch of Retail Marijuana or MedicalRegulated Marijuana \nflower, trim, or shake shall be determined as directed in subparagraphs (F)(4)(c)(i) \nthrough– (iv) of this Rule. \n3. The minimum number of Sample Increments required to be collected for each Test Batch \nfrom a Production Batch of Regulated Marijuana Product, Pre-Rolled Marijuana, Infused \nPre-Rolled Marijuana, Audited Product and Alternative Use Product shall be determined \nas directed in subparagraphs (F)(4)(c)(i) through– (iv) of this Rule. \na.

Reduced Testing Allowance and Ongoing Testing – Contaminant Testing. \n1. Regulated Marijuana. A Regulated Marijuana Cultivation Facility’s cultivation process \nmay achieve a Reduced Testing Allowance for contaminant testing if every \nHarvestProduction Batch that it produced during at least a six-week period (minimum 42 \ndays) but no longer than a 12-week period (maximum 84 days) passed all contaminant \ntests required by Rule 4-215(E). This must include at least six Test Batches. The period \nbegins from the date of the creation of the first Harvest Batch that passed Reduced \nTesting Allowance testing. A MedicalRegulated Marijuana Cultivation Facility, a Retail \nMarijuana Cultivation Facility, or an Accelerator Cultivator can achieve a Reduced \nTesting Allowance for all contaminants listed in Rule 4-215(E) at the same time or \nseparately for each contaminant. A Regulated Marijuana Cultivation Facility must \ncultivate and process all Harvest Batches or Production Batches the same way, including \nthe same growing media, lighting, pesticides, and drying, trimming, and packaging \nprocedures to be eligible to obtain and maintain a Reduced Testing Allowance. \n2. Regulated Marijuana Concentrate, Regulated Marijuana Product, Pre-Rolled Marijuana or \nInfused Pre-Rolled Marijuana. A Regulated Marijuana Business’s production process \nmay achieve a Reduced Testing Allowance for contaminant testing if for a particular type \nof Regulated Marijuana Concentrate, Regulated Marijuana Product, or Pre-Rolled \nMarijuana or Infused Pre-Rolled Marijuana every Production Batch that it produced \nduring at least a four-week period (minimum 28 days) but no longer than an eight-week \nperiod (maximum 56 days) passed all contaminant tests required by Rule 4-215(E). This \nmust include Test Batches from at least four Production Batches. This period begins from \nthe date of the creation of the first Production Batch that passed Reduced Testing \nAllowance testing. If a Regulated Marijuana Concentrate or Regulated Marijuana Product \nis manufactured using a different extraction process or infusion process or different \nhardware (such as different cartridge size, design, volume, or manufacturer) or using any \ndifferent Additives or Botanically Derived Compounds, it will be considered a different \ntype of Regulated Marijuana Concentrate or Regulated Marijuana Product and therefore \nmust separately achieve a Reduced Testing Allowance. If Pre-Rolled Marijuana or \nInfused Pre-Rolled Marijuana is produced using different input materials, such as a \ndifferent marijuana category (e.g. flower or trim), different wrapper materials, different \nprocesses, or different equipment, they must achieve separate Reduced Testing \nAllowances. \nC. Wet Whole Plant. A Regulated Marijuana Cultivation Facility’s cultivation process for wet whole \nplant shall be deemed acceptable for a Reduced Testing Allowance for microbial contaminant \ntesting if every HarvestProduction Batch of wet whole plant that it produced during at least a \n\nCODE OF COLORADO REGULATIONS 1 CCR 212-3 \nMarijuana Enforcement Division \n 271 \nthree-week (minimum 21 days) period but no longer than a 12-week (maximum 84 days) period ","rules":["4-120","4-121","4-125","4-230","4-215"],"start":787500},{"text":"e separate Reduced Testing \nAllowances. \nC.

Reduced Testing Allowance - Potency and Homogeneity. \n1. A Retail Marijuana Products Manufacturer or Accelerator Manufacturer may achieve a \nReduced Testing Allowance for potency and homogeneity for each type of Retail \nMarijuana Product it manufactures. \na. For Edible Retail Marijuana Products a potency test result that is within 15 \npercent of the target potency will count towards a Reduced Testing Allowance. \ni. For Edible Retail Marijuana Products that contain 2.5 milligrams of THC \na Cannabinoid or less per serving, a potency test result that is within the \ngreater of plus or minus 0.5 milligrams or 40 percent per serving will \ncount towards a Reduced Testing Allowance. \n2. A Medical Marijuana Products Manufacturer may achieve a Reduced Testing Allowance \nfor potency and homogeneity for each type of non-Edible Medical Marijuana Product and \neach type of Edible Medical Marijuana Product that it manufactures. \na. For Edible Medical Marijuana Products that contain 100 milligrams of THC or \nless per Container, a potency test result that is within 15 percent of the target \npotency will count towards a Reduced Testing Allowance. \ni. For Edible Medical Marijuana Products that contain 2.5 milligrams of \nTHC a Cannabinoid or less per serving and 100 milligrams of THC or \nless per Container, a potency test result that is within the greater of plus \nor minus 0.5 milligrams or 40 percent per serving will count towards a \nReduced Testing Allowance. \nb. For Edible Medical Marijuana Products that contain between 101 and 500 \nmilligrams of THC per Container, a potency test result that is within 10 percent of \nthe target potency will count towards a Reduced Testing Allowance. \nc. For Edible Medical Marijuana Products that contain 501 milligrams of THC or \nmore per Container, a potency test result that is within 5 percent of the target \npotency will count towards a Reduced Testing Allowance. \n3. A Regulated Marijuana Products Manufacturer’s production process for a particular type \nof Regulated Marijuana Product shall be deemed acceptable for a Reduced Testing \nAllowance for potency and homogeneity testing if every Production Batch that it produces \nfor that particular type of Regulated Marijuana Product during at least a four-week period \nbut no longer than an eight-week period passes all potency and homogeneity tests \nrequired by Rule 4-210. This must include at least four Test Batches. \nE. Expiration of a Reduced Testing Allowance. Once a Regulated Marijuana Business has \nsuccessfully achieved Reduced Testing Allowance for any contaminants listed in Rule 4-215 or \nPotency as required by 4-210(E), Reduced Testing Allowance is effective for one year from the \ndate of the first passing Harvest Batch or Production Batch. One year is equal to 365 days \ninclusive, or 366 days inclusive during a leap year. When the Reduced Testing Allowance \n\nCODE OF COLORADO REGULATIONS 1 CCR 212-3 \nMarijuana Enforcement Division \n 272 \nexpires, the Regulated Marijuana Business shall achieve new Reduced Testing Allowance or \nPerform all testing Required by 4-210 and 4-215. \nF. Reduced Testing Allowance Certification Fee. A Licensee seeking to obtain Reduced Testing \nAllowance must first pay the fee in Rule 2-140(A). \n1.

For qualitative methods, a minimum of three spiking/naturally occurring levels of target \nanalyte must be included assessing accuracy, precision and specificity per each matrix \nvalidated (microbiological methods shall be considered accurate/precise if fractional \nresults are obtained when limits are <1 CFU preanalytical portion): one negative level in \nwhich no analyte is present, one low level at which analyte is present at the regulatory \nlimit and one high level at which the analyte is present at 10x the regulatory limit. \n10. For quantitative methods, laboratories must include a minimum of four or more spiked \nlevels or more, covering the analytical range that assessesmust be included assessing \naccuracy, precision and specificity perof each matrix validated.: These must include one \nnegative level in which no analyte is present, one low level at which analyte is present at \nthe regulatory limit, one medium level for which the analyte is present at a concentration \nclose to the middle calibrator and one high level at which the analyte is present at the \nupper level of the calibration. \n11. For qualitative methods, at least two levels must be included for the negative and high \nlevel spikes - at least ten replicates must be included at the fractional level, per analyte, \nper matrix. \n12. For quantitative methods, at least two replicates must be performed at each spiked level \nper each matrix validated. \n13. Software must be validated prior to testing Test Batches, including but not limited to: \nanalytical software, application programming interface(s) (APIs), laboratory information \nmanagement systems (LIMS), etcetera. \n14.

Laboratories must validate or verify instrumentation and methodology immediately and \nprior to use following a change in location. \nJ. Testing Validation of Complex Matrices. A Retail Marijuana Testing Facility must include a variety \nof matrices as part of the validation/verification process. During method validation/verification, a \nRetail Marijuana Testing Facility must: \n1. Select matrices which best represent each category of products to be tested as listed in \nRule 4-215. The laboratory shall independently determine the category of matrix a \nproduct falls within; properties to consider include fat content, Cannabinoid content, pH, \nsalt content, sugar content, water activity, the presence of know chemical compounds, \nmicrobial flora and antimicrobial compounds. \n2. Perform a new matrix validation, prior to reporting results, on matrices which are either A) \na new category of matrix or B) considerably different from the original matrix validated \nwithin the category. \na. For example, the Retail Marijuana Testing Facility intends to receive the topical \nproduct “bath bombs” for testing, but previous validation studies for topical \nproduct included lotion and massage oil. A new validation should be performed \nfor the product prior to testing since salt content and other properties differ vastly \nfrom the original matrices validated. \n3. Perform a matrix verification (a client matrix spike or similar consisting of the target \nanalyte(s) at the time of analysis) on matrices submitted for testing which differ slightly \nfrom those initially validated but which fall within a category already validated. \na. For example, the Retail Marijuana Testing Facility receives a new edible type \nmatrix for testing (snickerdoodle cookies) but previous validation included \ngummies and hard candy. A spike of a portion of the submitted material must be \nanalyzed prior to, or at the time of, sample analysis. \nK. All Test Batches and Hemp Product must be tested as received, must not be manipulated, and \nmust be tested in a manner that ensures results are representative of the Test Batch as it is \nreceived. \nL.

The purpose of this rule is \nto establish the circumstances under which the Division may seek from a district court an administrative \nwarrant to search and/or seize marijuana and marijuana products, or other evidence indicating a violation \nof the Marijuana Code or rules. The Division has encountered circumstances that would have justified \nsuch a warrant.

The \npurpose of this rule is to set forth the process for summary suspensions when the State Licensing \nAuthority has cause to immediately suspend a license prior to and pending a hearing and final agency \norder. Summary suspensions will be imposed when the State Licensing Authority has reason to believe \n\nCODE OF COLORADO REGULATIONS 1 CCR 212-3 \nMarijuana Enforcement Division \n 545 \nand finds that a Licensee has been guilty of a deliberate and willful violation of any applicable law or \nregulation, or that the public health, safety, and welfare imperatively require emergency action. The rule \nensures proper due process for Licensees when their licenses are temporarily or summarily suspended \nby requiring prompt initiation of disciplinary proceedings after such suspensions. The purpose of the \nmodifications to this rule is to clarify that the hearing following the Order of Summary Suspension \nconcerns the allegations set forth in the Order to Show Cause. This Rule 8-210 was previously Rules M \nand R 1302, 1 CCR 212-1 and 1 CCR 212-2. \n8-210 – Summary Suspensions \nA. How a Summary Suspension Action is Initiated. \n1.

Proceedings for suspension or revocation shall be promptly instituted and determined \nafter the Summary Suspension Order is issued in accordance with the following \nprocedure: \na. After the Summary Suspension Order is issued, the State Licensing Authority \nshall promptly issue and serve upon the Licensee an Order to Show Cause \n(administrative citation) as to why the Licensee's license should not be \nsuspended, revoked, restricted, fined, or subject to other disciplinary sanction. \nb. The Order to Show Cause shall identify the statute, rule, regulation, or order \nallegedly violated, and the facts alleged to constitute the violation. The Order to \nShow Cause shall also provide an advisement that the license could be \nsuspended, revoked, restricted, fined or subject to disciplinary sanction should \nthe charges contained in the Order to Show Cause be sustained upon final \nhearing. \nc. The Order to Show Cause shall be filed with the Department’s Hearings Division. \nThe hearing on the allegations set forth in the Order to Show Cause shall be \nexpedited to the extent practicable and will be conducted in accordance with \nRule 8-220 – Administrative Hearings. \nB.

Authority also exists in the Colorado Constitution at Article XVIII, Subsection 16(5)(a)(I). The State \nLicensing Authority recognizes that if Licensees are not able to care for their products during a period of \nactive suspension, then their plants could die, their edible products could deteriorate, and their on-hand \ninventory may not be properly maintained. Accordingly, this rule was written to clarify that Licensees \n\nCODE OF COLORADO REGULATIONS 1 CCR 212-3 \nMarijuana Enforcement Division \n 546 \nwhose licenses are summarily suspended may care for on-hand inventory, manufactured products, and \nplants during the suspension (unless the State Licensing Authority does not allow such activity), provided \nthe Licensed Premises and all Regulated Marijuana is adequately secured.
